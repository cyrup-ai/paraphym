/// - Boxed clone method for trait object cloning
/// - Minimal trait bounds for maximum flexibility
/// - Maintains zero-allocation principles where possible

/// Core operation trait for zero-cost async-aware transformations
///
/// The Op trait defines the fundamental building block for composable workflow
/// operations. All implementations must be zero-allocation with Send + Sync + Clone
/// for maximum concurrent performance.
///
/// ## Architecture Constraints
/// - Zero-allocation with PhantomData for type safety
/// - Send + Sync + Clone for concurrent reusability
/// - Stream-only outputs (NO Future/Result wrapping)
/// - All hot-path methods marked #[inline] for zero-cost abstractions
/// - Clone for efficient operation sharing and composition
/// - Unwrapped Stream pattern - no Result wrapping in stream values
///
/// ## Performance Characteristics
/// - Concrete type specialization for blazing-fast execution
/// - Zero-cost abstractions through extensive inlining
/// - Memory-efficient with no heap allocation in execution paths
/// - Lock-free design for maximum concurrency
///
/// ## Example
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use paraphym_candle::workflow::ops::{Op, map};
///
/// let double_op = map(|x: i32| x * 2);
/// let stream = double_op.call(5);
/// // Result: Stream containing [10]
/// ```

    /// architecture for maximum performance.
    ///
    /// ## Implementation Requirements
    /// - Must use tokio Stream for return type (streams-only architecture)
    /// - Streams are async and should be awaited
    /// - Unwrapped stream values - no Result wrapping for performance
    /// - Real execution logic - no mocking or simulation
