## Parallel Execution Paths

### Phase 1 (Start Immediately)
- **Milestone 0**: Foundation & Safety
  - All unwrap/expect fixes
  - Critical for all other work

### Phase 2 (After Milestone 0)
- **Milestone 1**: Core Security (parallel with Milestone 2)
  - API key validation
  - Bearer token extraction
- **Milestone 2**: Protocol Processing (parallel with Milestone 1)
  - Cap'n Proto parser
  - GraphQL fragments

### Phase 3 (After Milestones 0, 1, 2)
- **Milestone 3**: Infrastructure Operations
  - Rate limiter reset
  - Health check implementation
  - Request handling
- **Milestone 4**: Monitoring & Observability (parallel with others)
  - Parser statistics
  - Conversion statistics
- **Milestone 5**: TLS & Certificate Management (parallel with others)
  - Wildcard cert matching
  - Domain validation
  - Certificate metadata
  - Keychain integration

### Phase 4 (After dependencies met)
- **Milestone 6**: Documentation & Polish
  - Language revisions (after Milestones 1, 2)

## Critical Path Analysis

**Longest path**: Milestone 0 → Milestone 1 → Milestone 3 (3 phases)
**Shortest path**: Milestone 0 → Milestone 4 (2 phases)

## Optimization Recommendations

1. **Start with Milestone 0** - Blocking for everything else
2. **Parallelize Milestones 1 & 2** - Independent after Milestone 0
3. **Phase 3 can be highly parallelized** - Multiple teams can work simultaneously
4. **Documentation can be done incrementally** - As each milestone completes

## Task Count by Milestone

- Milestone 0: 2 tasks (Foundation & Safety)
- Milestone 1: 2 tasks (Core Security)
- Milestone 2: 2 tasks (Protocol Processing)
- Milestone 3: 3 tasks (Infrastructure Operations)
- Milestone 4: 2 tasks (Monitoring & Observability)
- Milestone 5: 4 tasks (TLS & Certificate Management)
- Milestone 6: 2 tasks (Documentation & Polish)

**Total**: 17 tasks across 7 milestones
