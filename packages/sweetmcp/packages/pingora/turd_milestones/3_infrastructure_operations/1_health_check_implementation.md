# Health Check Implementation - Incomplete

## Description
Implement actual health checking in `src/edge/core/operations.rs` lines 250-254. Current implementation returns backend count instead of checking actual health status.

## Current Problem
```rust
async fn count_healthy_backends(&self) -> usize {
    // In a full implementation, this would ping each backend
    // For now, return total backend count
    self.backend_count()
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Implement actual TCP/HTTP health checks
- [ ] Add configurable health check intervals and timeouts
- [ ] Include circuit breaker integration
- [ ] Add health status caching with TTL
- [ ] Implement parallel health checking
- [ ] Support multiple health check protocols
- [ ] Track health check metrics and history

## Technical Resolution
- Implement actual TCP/HTTP health checks
- Add configurable health check intervals and timeouts
- Include circuit breaker integration
- Add health status caching with TTL
- Implement parallel health checking

## Dependencies
- Milestone 0 must be completed (foundation safety fixes)
- Milestone 1 must be completed (core security)

## Priority
HIGH - Critical for load balancing

## Files Affected
- `src/edge/core/operations.rs` (lines 250-254)

## Testing Requirements
- Test health check accuracy
- Test timeout handling
- Test parallel execution
- Test circuit breaker integration
- Test caching functionality
- Performance test health check speed
