- Line 4
  - hack

```rust
use surrealdb_core::val::{Bytes, Function, Value};

/// A hack for dealing with the issue that `<bytes>` is exported as a function call, which causes
/// problems when comparing values.
///
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `compute_bytes_inplace()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/language-tests/src/tests/schema/bytes_hack.rs` (line 8)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
///
/// This function computes any function call which matches an exported bytes inplace
pub fn compute_bytes_inplace(v: &mut Value) {
	match v {
		Value::Object(x) => x.values_mut().for_each(compute_bytes_inplace),
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
