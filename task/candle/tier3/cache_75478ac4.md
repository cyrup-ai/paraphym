---## Orphaned Methods


### `return_pooled_memory()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/memory/config/cache.rs` (line 109)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Return memory to connection pool
#[inline]
pub fn return_pooled_memory(memory: Arc<SurrealDBMemoryManager>) {
    use std::sync::atomic::Ordering;

```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.

- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Update global configuration cache with copy-on-write semantics
#[inline]
pub fn update_config_cache(new_config: MemoryConfig) {
    CONFIG_CACHE.store(Arc::new(new_config));
    // Clear thread-local caches to force refresh
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.

```rust
/// Get memory from connection pool with lock-free access
#[inline]
pub fn get_pooled_memory() -> Option<Arc<SurrealDBMemoryManager>> {
    use std::sync::atomic::Ordering;

```

### Action Required:
