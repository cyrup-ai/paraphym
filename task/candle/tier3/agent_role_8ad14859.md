- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: candle
- **File Hash**: 8ad14859

- **Lines of Code**: 1649

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 1649 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 1453
  - block_on
  - 

```rust
                | CandleChatLoop::Reprompt(user_message) => {
                    // Spawn stream to handle operations (uses shared runtime for async)
                    // BLOCKING CODE APPROVED: Using shared_runtime().block_on() for async operations within ystream closure (2025-01-XX)
                    let _background_stream = ystream::spawn_stream(move |stream_sender| {
                        // Create conversation with real user input for this inference
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 692: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        // Get default embedding model from registry
        let default_embedding_model = registry::get::<TextEmbeddingModel>("dunzhang/stella_en_400M_v5")
            .expect("Default embedding model not found in registry");
        
        CandleAgentBuilderImpl {
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 880: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        let embedding_model = self.text_embedding_model.unwrap_or_else(|| {
            registry::get::<TextEmbeddingModel>("dunzhang/stella_en_400M_v5")
                .expect("Default embedding model not found in registry")
        });
