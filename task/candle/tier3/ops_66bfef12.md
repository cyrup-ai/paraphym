---## Orphaned Methods


### `should_use_stack_allocation()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/memory/ops.rs` (line 89)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
#[allow(dead_code)]
#[must_use]
pub fn should_use_stack_allocation(embedding_size: usize) -> bool {
    embedding_size <= MAX_STACK_EMBEDDING_SIZE
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
