---## Orphaned Methods


### `pool_size()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/init/mod.rs` (line 109)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// # Returns
/// Number of available managers in the pool
pub fn pool_size() -> usize {
    MEMORY_SERVICE_POOL.len()
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `initialize_pool()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/init/mod.rs` (line 125)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// # Performance
/// Async initialization with proper error handling
pub async fn initialize_pool(pool_size: usize, config: MemoryConfig) -> Result<(), DomainInitError> {
    for _ in 0..pool_size {
        let manager = initialize_memory_service_with_config(config.clone()).await?;
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `get_from_pool()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/init/mod.rs` (line 93)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// # Returns
/// Shared reference to memory manager service, or None if pool is empty
pub fn get_from_pool() -> Option<Arc<SurrealDBMemoryManager>> {
    MEMORY_SERVICE_POOL.pop()
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.

### `initialize_memory_service()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/init/mod.rs` (line 24)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// - Database initialization fails
/// - Memory schema initialization fails
pub async fn initialize_memory_service() -> Result<SurrealDBMemoryManager, DomainInitError> {
    let config = get_default_memory_config();
    initialize_memory_service_with_config(config).await
```
