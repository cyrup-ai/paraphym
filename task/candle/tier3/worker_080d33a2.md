---## Orphaned Methods


### `check_memory_available()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/pool/core/worker.rs` (line 75)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// current_usage_mb + (num_workers * per_worker_mb) <= 0.80 * total_system_mb
/// ```
pub fn check_memory_available<T: CandleModel>(
    model: &T,
    current_usage_mb: usize,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `spawn_worker_thread()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/pool/core/worker.rs` (line 43)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// 3. Worker loop starts, processes requests until shutdown
/// 4. Worker owns model exclusively (no Arc<Mutex<>>)
pub fn spawn_worker_thread<T, F>(
    model_loader: F,
    worker_name: String,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
