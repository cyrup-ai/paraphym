```rust
// Re-export paraphym_memory types for convenience
// Removed unexpected cfg condition "paraphym-memory" - feature does not exist

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

```rust

/// Fallback trait definition (removed unexpected cfg condition "paraphym-memory")
pub trait MemoryManagerTrait: Send + Sync {
