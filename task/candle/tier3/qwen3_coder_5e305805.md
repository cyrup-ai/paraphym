- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: candle
- **File Hash**: 5e305805

- **Lines of Code**: 395

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 395 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

```rust
            .find(|f| f.rfilename.contains("Q4_K_M"))
            .or_else(|| {
                // Fallback to any .gguf file if Q4_K_M not found
                repo_info.siblings.iter().find(|f| f.rfilename.ends_with(".gguf"))
            })
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

```rust
        let content = gguf_file::Content::read(&mut file)?;

        // Extract Qwen3-specific metadata with Llama fallbacks - zero allocation parsing
        let hidden_size = content
            .metadata
```

## Orphaned Methods


### `validate_model_path()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/capability/text_to_text/qwen3_coder.rs` (line 516)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Returns error if the path does not exist or is not accessible
#[allow(dead_code)]
fn validate_model_path(path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
    let model_path = Path::new(path);

```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
