---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 588 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `sanitize_global_input()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/chat/commands/validation.rs` (line 774)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Sanitize input using global validator
#[must_use]
pub fn sanitize_global_input(input: &str) -> String {
    get_global_validator().sanitize_input(input)
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `validate_global_command()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/chat/commands/validation.rs` (line 768)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
///
/// Returns `ValidationError` if command validation fails (see `CommandValidator::validate_command`)
pub fn validate_global_command(command: &ImmutableChatCommand) -> Result<(), ValidationError> {
    get_global_validator().validate_command(command)
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `is_global_safe_input()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/chat/commands/validation.rs` (line 780)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Check if input is safe using global validator
#[must_use]
pub fn is_global_safe_input(input: &str) -> bool {
    get_global_validator().is_safe_input(input)
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
