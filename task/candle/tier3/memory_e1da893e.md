---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 380 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Orphaned Methods


### `memory_node()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/builders/memory.rs` (line 374)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Convenience function for creating memory nodes - EXACT syntax: memory_node()
#[inline]
pub fn memory_node() -> impl MemoryNodeBuilder {
    Memory::node()
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `memory_system()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/builders/memory.rs` (line 380)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Convenience function for creating memory systems - EXACT syntax: memory_system()
#[inline]
pub fn memory_system() -> impl MemorySystemBuilder {
    Memory::system()
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
