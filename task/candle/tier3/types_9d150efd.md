---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 498 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

- Line 25
  - actual
  - 

```rust
#[repr(u8)] // Optimize for minimal size and fast comparison
pub enum MemoryTypeEnum {
    /// Factual information and knowledge
    Fact = 0,
    /// Specific events and experiences
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.


- Line 57
  - backward compatibility
  - 

```rust
}

/// Type alias for backward compatibility
pub type MemoryType = MemoryTypeEnum;
