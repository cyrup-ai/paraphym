```rust
pub mod tests;

// Re-export main types to maintain backward compatibility
// Using a hybrid approach: explicit exports for conflicts, module re-exports for compatibility

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

```rust
// Using a hybrid approach: explicit exports for conflicts, module re-exports for compatibility

// Module re-exports for backward compatibility (keeping internal imports working)
// Manager types (explicit imports to avoid conflicts)

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 13: `#[cfg]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/memory/core/mod.rs` (line 13)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
pub mod tests;

// Re-export main types to maintain backward compatibility
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
