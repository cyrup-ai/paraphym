---## Orphaned Methods


### `execute_candle_command_async()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/chat/commands/mod.rs` (line 71)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Execute Candle command using global executor - STREAMING VERSION (streams-only architecture)
#[must_use]
pub fn execute_candle_command_async(command: ImmutableChatCommand) -> AsyncStream<CommandEvent> {
    AsyncStream::with_channel(move |sender| {
        if let Some(executor) = get_candle_command_executor() {
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `parse_candle_command()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/chat/commands/mod.rs` (line 56)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// - Candle command executor is not initialized
/// - Command parsing fails
pub fn parse_candle_command(input: &str) -> CommandResult<ImmutableChatCommand> {
    if let Some(executor) = get_candle_command_executor() {
        executor
```
