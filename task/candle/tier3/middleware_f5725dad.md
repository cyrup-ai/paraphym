- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: candle
- **File Hash**: f5725dad

- **Lines of Code**: 333

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 333 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Orphaned Methods


### `cors_middleware()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/memory/api/middleware.rs` (line 266)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Add CORS middleware
pub fn cors_middleware() -> CorsLayer {
    CorsLayer::new()
        .allow_origin(Any)
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `logging_middleware()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/memory/api/middleware.rs` (line 274)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Request logging middleware
pub async fn logging_middleware(request: Request<Body>, next: Next) -> impl IntoResponse {
    let method = request.method().clone();
    let uri = request.uri().clone();
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `auth_middleware()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/memory/api/middleware.rs` (line 288)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Production authentication middleware with JWT and API key support
pub async fn auth_middleware(mut request: Request<Body>, next: Next) -> impl IntoResponse {
    // Extract authorization header
    let auth_header = request
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
