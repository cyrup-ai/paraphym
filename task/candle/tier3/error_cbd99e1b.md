- **Project**: candle
- **File Hash**: cbd99e1b

- **Lines of Code**: 796

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 796 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Orphaned Methods


### `error_stats()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/error.rs` (line 777)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Get global error statistics
#[inline]
pub fn error_stats(category: ErrorCategory) -> &'static ErrorCounter {
    ERROR_AGGREGATOR.stats(category)
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `reset_error_stats()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/error.rs` (line 795)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Reset global error statistics
#[inline]
pub fn reset_error_stats() {
    ERROR_AGGREGATOR.reset();
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.

### `error_breaker()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/error.rs` (line 783)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Get global circuit breaker
#[inline]
pub fn error_breaker(category: ErrorCategory) -> &'static ErrorCircuitBreaker {
    ERROR_AGGREGATOR.breaker(category)
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
