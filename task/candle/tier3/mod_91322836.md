---## Orphaned Methods


### `tensor_to_image()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/domain/image_generation/mod.rs` (line 151)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Based on `save_image()` from candle-examples/src/lib.rs
/// See: ../../tmp/candle-examples/candle-examples/src/lib.rs
pub fn tensor_to_image(tensor: &Tensor) -> Result<DynamicImage, String> {
    // 1. Validate 3D tensor (C, H, W) - Candle's native format
    let (channels, height, width) = tensor
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
