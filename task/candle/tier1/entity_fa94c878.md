---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 488 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 477
  - For now
  - 

```rust
        if created_entity.id().is_empty() {
            // This would typically be handled by setting the ID on the entity
            // For now, we'll use the generated ID format
        }

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
