- **Project**: candle
- **File Hash**: e8794078

- **Lines of Code**: 357

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 357 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 172
  - would require
  - 

```rust
    ///
    /// ## Alternative Caching Approaches (Not Implemented)
    /// To implement model caching, would require one of:
    /// 1. **Trait redesign**: Change `&self` to `&mut self` (breaking API change)
    /// 2. **LazyStatic/OnceLock**: Requires `'static` lifetime, complex with device selection
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 82
  - Fallback
  - 

```rust
                        full_token_count - content_token_count
                    } else {
                        // Fallback: use character-based estimation if tokenization is inconsistent
                        let instruction_char_ratio = content_start_pos as f32 / formatted_text.len() as f32;
                        (instruction_char_ratio * full_token_count as f32).ceil() as usize
```
