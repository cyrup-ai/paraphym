```rust

    // Note: Actual tests would require proper mocking of the Agent and CompletionModel
    // These are placeholders to demonstrate the test structure

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 19: `#[cfg]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/context/extraction/mod.rs` (line 19)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use serde::Deserialize;

```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
  


### Line 33: `#[test]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/context/extraction/mod.rs` (line 33)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust
    // These are placeholders to demonstrate the test structure
    #[test]
    fn test_extractor_creation() {
        // Test would create a mock agent and verify extractor creation
        assert!(true);
```
