---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 619 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 13: `#[cfg]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/memory/monitoring/mod.rs` (line 13)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
pub mod tests;

// Re-export main types
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
