- Line 44
  - In a real

```rust

    // Verify cognitive enhancement was applied
    // In a real test, we'd check the database for cognitive metadata
}

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.


- Line 359
  - In a real
  - 

```rust
// Helper function to get current memory usage
fn get_current_memory_usage() -> usize {
    // In a real implementation, would use system APIs to get actual memory usage
    // For now, return a placeholder
    1024 * 1024 * 100 // 100 MB

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 25: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Should use .expect() with descriptive message in tests

```rust

    let manager = CognitiveMemoryManager::new(
        &std::env::var("SURREAL_TEST_URL").unwrap(),
        "test_ns",
        "test_db",
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 79: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Should use .expect() with descriptive message in tests

```rust

### Line 321: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Should use .expect() with descriptive message in tests

```rust
            .create_memory(memory.clone())
