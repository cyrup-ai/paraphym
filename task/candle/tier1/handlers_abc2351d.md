- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `get_metrics()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/memory/api/handlers.rs` (line 201)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Metrics endpoint
pub async fn get_metrics(
    State(memory_manager): State<Arc<SurrealMemoryManager>>,
) -> Result<String, StatusCode> {
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.

- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Health check endpoint
pub async fn get_health(
    State(memory_manager): State<Arc<SurrealMemoryManager>>,
) -> Json<HealthResponse> {
```

### Action Required:
