- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: candle
- **File Hash**: a79ce403

- **Lines of Code**: 311

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 311 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 352
  - stubby variable name
  - performance_mock

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod performance_mock {
    use super::*;

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 2 (possible) Infractions 


- Line 358
  - Mock
  - 

```rust
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self {
                // Mock implementation
            }
        }
```

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 85: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Should use .expect() with descriptive message in tests

```rust
        config,
    )
    .unwrap();

    // Run recursive improvement
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 88: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()

```rust

    // Run recursive improvement

    // Get results
```
