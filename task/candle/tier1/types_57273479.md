---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 1307 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 1404
  - For now
  - 

```rust
    ) {
        // Calculate temporal distance (milliseconds)
        // For now, use sequence-based distance as proxy
        let _temporal_ctx = &*self.temporal_context;
        let temporal_distance = 0i64; // Placeholder - would need memory timestamp lookup
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 1238
  - actual

```rust
        }
        
        // Create the actual entanglement bond in quantum signature
        if let Err(e) = self.quantum_signature.create_entanglement_bond(
            target_id,
