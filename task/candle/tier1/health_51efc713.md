- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: candle
- **File Hash**: 51efc713  
- **Timestamp**: 2025-10-10T02:15:58.143814+00:00  
- **Lines of Code**: 407

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 407 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 390
  - For now
  - 

```rust
                
                // Dimensions and index quality require trait extension or type-specific methods
                // For now, use sensible defaults or get from config
                let dimensions = embedding_dims as u32;
                let index_quality = 100.0f32; // Assume healthy if count() succeeds
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
