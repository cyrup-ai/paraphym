---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 716 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 794
  - hardcoded URL
  - 

```rust
        let branch = branch.unwrap_or("main");
        let url = format!(
            "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{}/{}/{}",
            repo, branch, path
        );
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `document()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/builders/document.rs` (line 881)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Convenience function for fluent document creation
#[inline]
pub fn document() -> impl DocumentBuilder {
    Document::from_text("")
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
