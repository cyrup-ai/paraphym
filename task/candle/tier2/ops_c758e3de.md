```rust
    /// - No .await on AsyncStream (streams are consumed, not awaited)  
    /// - Unwrapped stream values - no Result wrapping for performance
    /// - Real execution logic - no mocking or simulation
    /// - Hot path should be marked #[inline] for zero-cost abstractions
    fn call(&self, input: In) -> AsyncStream<Out>;
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `passthrough()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/workflow/ops.rs` (line 366)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// ```
#[inline]
pub fn passthrough<T>() -> Passthrough<T>
where
    T: Send + Sync + Clone + 'static,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
