---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 527 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 2 (possible) Infractions 


- Line 548
  - placeholder
  - 

```rust
    /// Tokenize prompt with image tokens (static version for thread)
    ///
    /// Handles <image> placeholder insertion for multimodal embeddings
    fn tokenize_image_prompt_static(
        tokenizer: &Tokenizer,
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 47
  - actual
  - 

```rust
/// for image understanding and visual question answering.
///
/// The actual LLaVA model runs on a dedicated thread to avoid Send/Sync issues
/// with Candle's Module trait. Communication happens via channels.
/// Thread spawns lazily on first use.
