```rust
/// impl CandleWorkflowStep<String, String> for SimpleStep {
///     fn execute(&self, input: String) -> AsyncStream<String> {
///         // Real execution logic here - no mocking, no Result wrapping
///         AsyncStream::with_channel(|sender| {
///             match process_input(&input) {
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

```rust
    /// - No .await on AsyncStream (streams are consumed, not awaited)
    /// - NO Result<T, E> wrapping - error handling via handle_error! macro

## Orphaned Methods


### `candle_workflow()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/candle/src/workflow/core.rs` (line 86)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Public constructor for creating candle workflows
/// Returns a simple executable workflow that passes through its input
pub fn candle_workflow() -> CandleExecutableWorkflow<CandlePassthroughStep> {
    CandleExecutableWorkflow {
        step: CandlePassthroughStep,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
