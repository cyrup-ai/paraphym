# IMPL_4: Forwarding Statistics Tracking

## EXPERT CONTEXT REQUIRED
You must be familiar with [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) (MCP) request/response patterns to work on this task.

## OBJECTIVE
Replace placeholder zeros in `get_forwarding_stats()` with actual values from the **existing** `ConnectionStatsTracker` to enable monitoring and observability.

## CONTEXT

**Target File:** [`packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/forwarding.rs`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/forwarding.rs)  
**Current Implementation:** Lines 224-231  
**Problem:** Returns hardcoded zeros despite stats being tracked in `ConnectionStatsTracker`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Breaks monitoring/observability features

### Current Code (BROKEN)
```rust
pub fn get_forwarding_stats(&self) -> ForwardingStats {
    // This would be implemented with actual metrics collection
    // For now, returning placeholder values
    ForwardingStats {
        total_requests: 0,
        successful_requests: 0,
        failed_requests: 0,
        average_response_time_ms: 0.0,
        last_request_time: None,
    }
}
```

## EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE

### 1. ConnectionStatsTracker (Already Implemented)
**Location:** [`packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/core.rs:16-30`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/core.rs#L16-L30)

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct ConnectionStatsTracker {
    /// Number of currently active requests
    active: AtomicUsize,
    /// Total requests sent since bridge creation
    total_requests: AtomicU64,
    /// Total failed requests
    failed_requests: AtomicU64,
    /// Bridge creation time for uptime calculation
    _start_time: Instant,
}
```

**Key Insight:** This struct ALREADY TRACKS all the statistics we need! It's used internally by `McpBridge`.

### 2. McpBridge Structure
**Location:** [`packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/core.rs:38-49`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/core.rs#L38-L49)

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct McpBridge {
    pub(super) client: Client,
    pub(super) mcp_server_url: String,
    pub(super) timeout: Duration,
    stats_tracker: Arc<ConnectionStatsTracker>,  // ← Has stats!
}
```

The `stats_tracker` field contains all the statistics, but it's private to the bridge module.

### 3. Existing Statistics Tracking
**Location:** [`packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/core.rs:189-210`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/core.rs#L189-L210)

```rust
pub(super) async fn send_request(&self, json_rpc_request: Value) -> Result<Value> {
    // Track request start
    self.stats_tracker.total_requests.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    self.stats_tracker.active.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    
    // ... send request ...

    // Track request completion
    self.stats_tracker.active.fetch_sub(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    
    match response {
        Ok(resp) => self.handle_http_response(resp).await,
        Err(e) => {
            self.stats_tracker.failed_requests.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
            Err(e)
        }
    }
}
```

**Statistics are ALREADY being tracked!** We just need to expose them.

### 4. ForwardingStats Type (Already Defined)
**Location:** [`packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/forwarding.rs:366-376`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/forwarding.rs#L366-L376)

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
#[allow(dead_code)]
pub struct ForwardingStats {
    pub total_requests: u64,
    pub successful_requests: u64,
    pub failed_requests: u64,
    pub average_response_time_ms: f64,
    pub last_request_time: Option<chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>>,
}
```

This struct has helper methods like `success_rate()`, `failure_rate()`, and `is_healthy()`.

## THE SOLUTION (SIMPLE!)

The infrastructure **already exists** and is **already tracking statistics**. We just need to expose the stats from `ConnectionStatsTracker` through `ForwardingStats`.

### SUBTASK 1: Update get_forwarding_stats() Implementation

**What:** Replace placeholder zeros with actual values from `stats_tracker`  
**Where:** [`forwarding.rs:224-231`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/forwarding.rs#L224-L231)  
**Why:** Expose the statistics that are already being tracked

**Current Code:**
```rust
pub fn get_forwarding_stats(&self) -> ForwardingStats {
    // This would be implemented with actual metrics collection
    // For now, returning placeholder values
    ForwardingStats {
        total_requests: 0,
        successful_requests: 0,
        failed_requests: 0,
        average_response_time_ms: 0.0,
        last_request_time: None,
    }
}
```

**Required Implementation:**
```rust
pub fn get_forwarding_stats(&self) -> ForwardingStats {
    let total = self.stats_tracker.total_requests.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    let failed = self.stats_tracker.failed_requests.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    
    // Calculate successful requests (total - failed)
    let successful = total.saturating_sub(failed);
    
    ForwardingStats {
        total_requests: total,
        successful_requests: successful,
        failed_requests: failed,
        // TODO: Response time tracking requires additional infrastructure
        average_response_time_ms: 0.0,
        // TODO: Last request time tracking requires additional infrastructure  
        last_request_time: None,
    }
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Uses existing `stats_tracker` field from `McpBridge`
- Atomics ensure thread-safe reads with `Ordering::Relaxed`
- Calculates successful requests as `total - failed` (correct formula)
- Leaves `average_response_time_ms` and `last_request_time` as TODOs (require more work)

### Why Not Track Response Time Yet?

To track average response time, we'd need to:
1. Add `AtomicU64` for cumulative response time
2. Track start/end time for each request
3. Calculate average as `cumulative_time / total_requests`

This is **out of scope** for this task. The current implementation focuses on request counts only.

### Why Not Track Last Request Time Yet?

To track last request time, we'd need:
1. Add `Arc<RwLock<Option<DateTime>>>` or similar
2. Update on every request
3. Handle timezone conversion

Also **out of scope**. Request counts are the priority.

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Required Imports

**Add to top of [`forwarding.rs`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/forwarding.rs):**
```rust
use std::sync::atomic::Ordering;
```

This is needed for `load(Ordering::Relaxed)` calls on the atomic counters.

### No Struct Changes Required

**DO NOT** modify:
- `McpBridge` struct (already has `stats_tracker`)
- `ConnectionStatsTracker` struct (already tracks what we need)
- `ForwardingStats` struct (already has correct fields)
- `send_request()` method (already tracks statistics)

**ONLY** modify:
- `get_forwarding_stats()` method implementation

## VERIFICATION STEPS

After implementation:

1. **Compilation:** `cargo check -p sweetmcp_daemon`
2. **Verify Calculation:** Ensure `successful = total - failed` (not `total - failed - active`)
3. **Atomic Ordering:** Confirm `Ordering::Relaxed` is used (sufficient for statistics)
4. **Helper Methods:** Verify `ForwardingStats::success_rate()` works correctly with real values

## DEFINITION OF DONE

```markdown
- [ ] `std::sync::atomic::Ordering` import added
- [ ] `get_forwarding_stats()` loads `total_requests` from stats_tracker
- [ ] `get_forwarding_stats()` loads `failed_requests` from stats_tracker
- [ ] `get_forwarding_stats()` calculates `successful_requests` as total - failed
- [ ] `average_response_time_ms` and `last_request_time` remain as 0.0/None (TODO)
- [ ] Code compiles without errors: `cargo check -p sweetmcp_daemon`
- [ ] Code compiles without warnings in forwarding.rs
- [ ] ForwardingStats helper methods (success_rate, is_healthy) work with real data
```

## TECHNICAL NOTES

### Atomic Ordering Choice

**`Ordering::Relaxed` is correct for statistics** because:
- No memory ordering constraints needed
- Statistics are best-effort, not critical
- Performance is critical (this is a hot path)
- Other atomic orderings (Acquire, Release, SeqCst) are unnecessary overhead

### Successful Request Calculation

**Formula:** `successful = total - failed`

**Why not track successful separately?**
- Reduces atomic operations in hot path
- Derived metric is equally accurate
- `send_request()` only increments total and failed
- No need for third counter

### saturating_sub() Usage

```rust
let successful = total.saturating_sub(failed);
```

**Why saturating_sub?**
- Handles edge case where failed > total (should never happen, but defensive)
- Returns 0 instead of panicking on underflow
- Costs almost nothing performance-wise

## REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATIONS

### ConnectionStats (Similar Pattern)
**Location:** [`core.rs:187-195`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/core.rs#L187-L195)

```rust
pub fn get_connection_stats(&self) -> ConnectionStats {
    ConnectionStats {
        active_connections: self.stats_tracker.active.load(Ordering::Relaxed),
        idle_connections: 0, // reqwest doesn't expose pool idle count
        total_requests: self.stats_tracker.total_requests.load(Ordering::Relaxed),
        failed_requests: self.stats_tracker.failed_requests.load(Ordering::Relaxed),
    }
}
```

**Pattern to follow:** Direct atomic loads with Ordering::Relaxed, placeholder values for unimplemented fields.

### Atomic Counter Tracking
**Location:** [`core.rs:189-210`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/core.rs#L189-L210)

Shows how statistics are being tracked in `send_request()`.

✅ **DO** leave TODOs for unimplemented fields

---

## SUBTASK 4: Update get_forwarding_stats() in forwarding.rs

**File:** [`packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/forwarding.rs`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/forwarding.rs)  
**Location:** Lines 224-233 (get_forwarding_stats implementation)

**What:** Replace hardcoded zeros with actual values from ConnectionStatsTracker.

**Current Implementation:**

```rust
pub fn get_forwarding_stats(&self) -> ForwardingStats {
    ForwardingStats {
        total_requests: 0,
        successful_requests: 0,
        failed_requests: 0,
        average_response_time_ms: 0.0,
        last_request_time: None,
    }
}
```

**Updated Implementation:**

```rust
pub fn get_forwarding_stats(&self) -> ForwardingStats {
    let total = self.stats_tracker.total_requests.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    let successful = self.stats_tracker.successful_requests.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    let failed = self.stats_tracker.failed_requests.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    let total_time_ms = self.stats_tracker.total_response_time_ms.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    
    // Calculate average response time (avoid division by zero)
    let average_response_time_ms = if successful > 0 {
        total_time_ms as f64 / successful as f64
    } else {
        0.0
    };
    
    // Get last request time (handle mutex lock)
    let last_request_time = self.stats_tracker.last_request_time
        .lock()
        .ok()
        .and_then(|guard| *guard);
    
    ForwardingStats {
        total_requests: total,
        successful_requests: successful,
        failed_requests: failed,
        average_response_time_ms,
        last_request_time,
    }
}
```

**Notes:**
- Use `Ordering::Relaxed` for all atomic loads (consistent with existing patterns)
- Calculate average only over successful requests (failed requests may timeout with artificially high times)
- Handle mutex lock failure gracefully with `.ok().and_then()`
- Avoid division by zero when no successful requests yet

## SUBTASK 5: Add Required Imports

**File:** [`packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/core.rs`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/core.rs)  
**Location:** Top of file (imports section)

**What:** Ensure `chrono` and `Mutex` are imported.

**Add if missing:**

```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, AtomicUsize, Ordering};
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};  // Add Mutex here
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};  // Add this import
```

**Verify Cargo.toml:**

Ensure `chrono` is in dependencies. Check [`packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/Cargo.toml`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/Cargo.toml):

```toml
[dependencies]
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
```

---

## DEFINITION OF DONE

- [ ] `ConnectionStatsTracker` extended with 3 new fields in core.rs
- [ ] `ConnectionStatsTracker::new()` initializes all new fields in core.rs  
- [ ] `send_request()` tracks timing, successful requests, and last request time in core.rs
- [ ] `get_forwarding_stats()` returns real values from stats_tracker in forwarding.rs
- [ ] Required imports (`chrono`, `Mutex`) added to core.rs
- [ ] Code compiles without errors: `cargo check -p sweetmcp-daemon`
- [ ] Average response time calculation handles division by zero
- [ ] Mutex lock failure handled gracefully in get_forwarding_stats()

---

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Why Track Success in handle_http_response()?

The current code structure has a subtle but important distinction:

1. `send_request()` sends the HTTP request
2. `handle_http_response()` validates the response and parses JSON

A request can fail in two ways:
- **Network/HTTP failure**: Connection refused, timeout, non-2xx status → caught in `send_request()` match
- **Response parsing failure**: Invalid JSON, empty response → caught in `handle_http_response()`

We track success only when BOTH succeed, which is why we increment `successful_requests` after `handle_http_response()` returns `Ok()`.

### Atomic Ordering: Why Relaxed?

Statistics counters don't require strict ordering guarantees:
- **Relaxed ordering** provides best performance
- Eventual consistency is acceptable for metrics
- No synchronization needed between different counters
- Still provides atomicity (no lost increments)

Reference: [`core.rs:203-228`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/bridge/core.rs#L203-L228) already uses `Ordering::Relaxed` consistently.

### Response Time Tracking Strategy

We track **total response time** and **successful requests** separately, then calculate average on-demand in `get_forwarding_stats()`. This approach:
- Minimizes atomic operations (one add per request vs. updating average)
- Avoids floating-point atomics (not available in std)
- Provides exact average (no rounding errors from incremental averaging)
- Failed requests excluded from average (they may timeout with misleading times)

### Thread Safety Considerations

- `AtomicU64`: Lock-free concurrent increment from multiple requests
- `Mutex<DateTime>`: Rare contention (only updated once per request, not hot path)
- `stats_tracker: Arc<ConnectionStatsTracker>`: Shared across clones of McpBridge

### File Structure

```

## RESEARCH REFERENCES

### Existing Atomic Patterns in Codebase

See [`packages/sweetmcp/packages/pingora/src/circuit_breaker.rs`](../packages/sweetmcp/packages/pingora/src/circuit_breaker.rs) for similar atomic counter patterns with `AtomicU64` and `Ordering::Relaxed`.

### MCP Protocol Context

Model Context Protocol (MCP) uses JSON-RPC 2.0 for request/response communication. The forwarding statistics track metrics for these JSON-RPC requests being proxied through the daemon's SSE bridge to the sweetmcp-axum server.

**Request Flow:**
1. Client → SSE Bridge → `forward_request()` → `send_request()` → HTTP POST → MCP Server
2. MCP Server → JSON-RPC Response → `handle_http_response()` → SSE Bridge → Client

Statistics tracking captures this entire request lifecycle.

## CARGO COMMANDS

```bash
# Check compilation
cargo check -p sweetmcp-daemon

# Build the daemon
cargo build -p sweetmcp-daemon

# Run with debug logging to see stats
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -p sweetmcp-daemon
```

---

## VALIDATION APPROACH

After implementation, verify statistics work correctly:

1. **Manual Testing**: Start daemon, send requests, check stats increase
2. **Compilation**: Must pass `cargo check -p sweetmcp-daemon`
3. **Code Review**: Verify atomic operations use consistent ordering

No formal unit tests required per project requirements.
