## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 186: `#[cfg]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/simd/src/logits/processing.rs` (line 186)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use float_eq::assert_float_eq;

```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
