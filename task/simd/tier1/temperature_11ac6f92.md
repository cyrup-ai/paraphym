## Orphaned Methods


### `neon_temperature_scale()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/simd/src/ops/temperature.rs` (line 164)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
#[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]
#[target_feature(enable = "neon")]
unsafe fn neon_temperature_scale(logits: &mut [f32], temperature: f32) -> SimdResult<()> {
    use std::arch::aarch64::*;

```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
