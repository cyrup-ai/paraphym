---## Orphaned Methods


### `array_of_integers()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/simd/src/serde_constraints.rs` (line 315)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `tokenizer` - Tokenizer for token-to-text conversion
    pub fn array_of_integers(tokenizer: &Tokenizer) -> AnyResult<SchemaConstraint> {
        let schema_json = r#"{
            "type": "array", 
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `object_with_string_keys()`
