```rust
//! Production-quality vectorized implementations shared across paraphym packages:
//! - Vector similarity operations (from memory package)
//! - Platform-specific optimizations and fallbacks
//!
//! ## Core Features
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

```rust
//! - **Zero Allocation**: Pre-allocated buffers and stack-based temporary storage
//! - **Adaptive Selection**: Automatic SIMD vs scalar selection based on vector size
//! - **Platform Support**: `x86_64` `AVX2`, `ARM64` `NEON` with portable fallbacks
//!
//! ## Usage Examples
```
