```rust
pub use super::penalties::apply_penalties_simd as apply_penalties_scalar;
pub use super::penalties::*;
// Legacy compatibility - scalar functions are now SIMD functions
pub use super::processing::normalize_probabilities_simd as normalize_probabilities_scalar;

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
