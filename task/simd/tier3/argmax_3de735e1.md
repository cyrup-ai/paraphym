- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

  - fall back
  - 

```rust

    // For NEON, fall back to scalar implementation for correct index tracking
    // The SIMD complexity of tracking indices correctly isn't worth it for most use cases
    scalar_argmax(logits)

## Orphaned Methods


### `neon_argmax()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/simd/src/ops/argmax.rs` (line 202)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
#[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]
#[target_feature(enable = "neon")]
unsafe fn neon_argmax(logits: &[f32]) -> SimdResult<usize> {
    if logits.is_empty() {
        return Err(crate::error::SimdError::InvalidInput(
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
