---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 307 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

```rust
use crate::runtime::SoftmaxDispatch;

/// Scalar implementation of softmax as a fallback
fn scalar_softmax(logits: &[f32]) -> SimdResult<Vec<f32>> {
    if logits.is_empty() {
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `create_softmax_dispatch()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/simd/src/ops/softmax.rs` (line 338)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
pub static SOFTMAX_DISPATCH: Lazy<SoftmaxDispatch> = Lazy::new(create_softmax_dispatch);

fn create_softmax_dispatch() -> SoftmaxDispatch {
    SoftmaxDispatch {
        #[cfg(any(target_arch = "x86", target_arch = "x86_64"))]
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `avx512_softmax()`
