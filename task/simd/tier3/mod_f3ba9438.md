---## Orphaned Methods


### `smart_cosine_similarity()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/simd/src/similarity/mod.rs` (line 53)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// vector size and CPU capabilities.
#[inline]
pub fn smart_cosine_similarity(a: &[f32], b: &[f32]) -> f32 {
    cosine_similarity(a, b)
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `simd_cosine_similarity()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/simd/src/similarity/mod.rs` (line 62)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// which already uses SIMD when appropriate. Kept for API compatibility.
#[inline]
pub fn simd_cosine_similarity(a: &[f32], b: &[f32]) -> f32 {
    cosine_similarity(a, b)
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `active_implementation()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/simd/src/similarity/mod.rs` (line 68)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Get the name of the currently active similarity implementation
#[inline]
pub fn active_implementation() -> &'static str {
    GLOBAL_SIMILARITY.name()
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
