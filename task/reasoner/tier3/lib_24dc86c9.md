---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 543 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Orphaned Methods


### `manifest()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/plugins/reasoner/src/lib.rs` (line 580)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
// Plugin manifest for tool definition
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn manifest(_: String) -> FnResult<String> {
    let manifest = serde_json::json!({
        "name": "mcp-reasoner",
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
