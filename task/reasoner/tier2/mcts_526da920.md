---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 443 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 2 (possible) Infractions 


- Line 98
  - placeholder
  - 

```rust
        let new_node_id = Uuid::new_v4().to_string();
        let parent_prefix = node.base.thought.split_whitespace().take(5).collect::<Vec<_>>().join(" ");
        // Simple heuristic continuation - better than a pure placeholder
        let new_thought = format!(
            "Considering '{}...', a possible next step is...",
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 3 Evaluations

```rust

    async fn calculate_possible_paths(&self, node: &MCTSNode) -> usize {
        // Count actual paths explored down to simulation depth
        self.count_paths_recursive(&node.base.id, node.base.depth)
            .await
