- **Project**: reasoner
- **File Hash**: e56ef0e5

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 705 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 2 (possible) Infractions 


- Line 612
  - placeholder
  - 

```rust
                let novelty_bonus = policy_node.novelty_score.unwrap_or(0.0) * self.novelty_bonus; // Default 0.5 * bonus

                // Combine base score with placeholder bonuses
                total_score += (base_score + policy_bonus + value_bonus + novelty_bonus) / 4.0;
            } else {
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 615
  - Fallback
  - 

```rust
                total_score += (base_score + policy_bonus + value_bonus + novelty_bonus) / 4.0;
            } else {
                // Fallback to just the base score if conversion fails (shouldn't happen often)
                total_score += node.score;
            }
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 258: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        // APPROVED BY DAVID MAPLE 09/30/2025: Panic is appropriate for hardcoded regex compilation
        let re = regex::Regex::new(r"[.!?;]|therefore|because|if|then")
            .expect("Failed to compile regex pattern");
        let complexity_score = re.find_iter(&node.base.thought).count() as f64 / 10.0; // Simple complexity heuristic

```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
