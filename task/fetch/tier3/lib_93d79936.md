---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 512 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

```rust

    rt.block_on(async {
        // Multi-stage fetching with fallbacks:

        // 1. First attempt: Use chromiumoxide (headless browser)
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `plugin()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/plugins/fetch/src/lib.rs` (line 647)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Create the plugin instance
fn plugin() -> McpPlugin<Ready> {
    mcp_plugin("fetch")
        .description(
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `extract_title()`

// Extract title from HTML
fn extract_title(html: &str) -> String {
    let title_start = html.find("<title>");
    let title_end = html.find("</title>");
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
