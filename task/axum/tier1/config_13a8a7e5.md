- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `basename()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/axum/src/config.rs` (line 55)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Used internally by the logger implementation
#[doc(hidden)]
pub fn basename(path_str: &str) -> String {
    // Make pub
    Path::new(path_str)
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `parse_config()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/axum/src/config.rs` (line 158)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// If the extension is missing or unrecognized, it falls back to detecting the format from the
/// content.
pub fn parse_config<T: serde::de::DeserializeOwned>(content: &str, file_path: &Path) -> Result<T> {
    if let Some(extension) = file_path.extension().and_then(|ext| ext.to_str()) {
        // If we have a file extension, try that format first
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `init_logger()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/axum/src/config.rs` (line 13)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Initialize the logger with the specified path and level
pub fn init_logger(path: Option<&str>, level: Option<&str>) -> Result<()> {
    let log_level = LevelFilter::from_str(level.unwrap_or("info"))?;

```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `validate_config()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/axum/src/config.rs` (line 105)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Validate the configuration content
pub fn validate_config(content: &str) -> Result<()> {
    // First try to parse as a generic Value to check basic format
    let format = detect_format_from_content(content)?;
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `default_max_depth()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/axum/src/config.rs` (line 196)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

fn default_max_depth() -> usize { 3 }

/// Root configuration
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
