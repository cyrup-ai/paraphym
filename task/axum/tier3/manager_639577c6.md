---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 346 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 205: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                .path
                .strip_prefix("oci://")
                .expect("OCI path should start with oci://"); // Expect acceptable if format is guaranteed
            let target_file_path = "/plugin.wasm";
            let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 217: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                    path
                })
                .expect("Failed to determine cache directory"); // Expect acceptable for critical paths
            std::fs::create_dir_all(&cache_dir).ok(); // ok() is fine, ignore error if dir exists

```

```rust
            let local_output_path_str = local_output_path
                .to_str()
                .expect("Local cache path is not valid UTF-8");

            // Use the CLI flag to determine whether to skip signature verification
```
