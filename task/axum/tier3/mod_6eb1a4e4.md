---## Orphaned Methods


### `create_cursor()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/axum/src/resource/mod.rs` (line 41)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Create a cursor from a resource
fn create_cursor(resource: &crate::types::Resource) -> String {
    // Use base64 encoding of URI for safe cursor transmission
    use base64::{Engine as _, engine::general_purpose};
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.

```rust

/// Parse a cursor to extract the last URI
pub fn parse_cursor(cursor: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
    use base64::{Engine as _, engine::general_purpose};
    general_purpose::STANDARD.decode(cursor)
```

### Action Required:
