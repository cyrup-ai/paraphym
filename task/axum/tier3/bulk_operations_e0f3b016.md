### `export_all()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/axum/src/plugin/bulk_operations.rs` (line 16)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

pub async fn export_all() -> Result<BulkExport, String> {
    let client = crate::db::client::get_db_client()
        .map_err(|e| format!("Database unavailable: {}", e))?;
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
