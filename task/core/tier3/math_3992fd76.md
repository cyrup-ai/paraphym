---## Orphaned Methods


### `stddev()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/fnc/math.rs` (line 201)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

pub fn stddev((array,): (Vec<Number>,)) -> Result<Value> {
	Ok(array.deviation(true).into())
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.

```rust
}

pub fn lerpangle((from, to, factor): (Number, Number, Number)) -> Result<Value> {
	Ok(factor.lerp_angle(from, to).into())
}
```

### Action Required:
