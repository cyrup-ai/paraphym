---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 140: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
	#[test]
	fn timestamps_can_be_added_duration() {
		let t = Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2000, 1, 1, 12, 30, 0).unwrap();
		let ts = Timestamp {
			value: t.timestamp_millis() as u64,
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 150: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
		let ts = ts + hour;

		let end_time = Utc.timestamp_millis_opt(ts.value as i64).unwrap();
		let expected_end_time = Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2000, 1, 1, 15, 30, 0).unwrap();
		assert_eq!(end_time, expected_end_time);

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 130: `#[cfg]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/dbs/node.rs` (line 130)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
	use std::time::Duration;

```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
  


### Line 139: `#[test]`
