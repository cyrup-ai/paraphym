---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 98: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

		// Create 3 temporary directories.
		let (dir1, dir2, dir3) = (tempdir().unwrap(), tempdir().unwrap(), tempdir().unwrap());
		// First two directories are allowed
		let combined = format!(
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 71: `#[cfg]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/iam/file.rs` (line 71)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
	use tempfile::tempdir;

```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
  


### Line 77: `#[test]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/iam/file.rs` (line 77)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

	#[test]
	fn test_empty_allow_list_allows_access() {
		// Create a temporary file in a temp directory.
		let dir = tempdir().expect("failed to create temp dir");
```

### Action Required

### Line 89: `#[test]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/iam/file.rs` (line 89)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

	#[test]
	fn test_allow_list_access() {
		// Use the appropriate delimiter for the platform.
		let delimiter = if cfg!(target_os = "windows") {
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
