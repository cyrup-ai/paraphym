---## Orphaned Methods


### `platform()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/fnc/script/modules/os.rs` (line 11)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Get the target operating system
#[js::function]
pub fn platform() -> &'static str {
	crate::env::os()
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
