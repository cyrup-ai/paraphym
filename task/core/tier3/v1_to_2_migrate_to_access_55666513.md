---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 51: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

		// We suffix the last id with a null byte, to prevent scanning it twice (which would result in an infinite loop)
		beg.clone_from(keys.last().unwrap());
		beg.extend_from_slice(b"\0");

```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 61: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
	for key in queue.iter() {
		// Get the value for the old key. We can unwrap the option, as we know that the key exists in the KV store
		let tk: DefineTokenStatement = revision::from_slice(&tx.get(key, None).await?.unwrap())?;
		// Convert into access
		let ac: DefineAccessStatement = tk.into();
```

## Orphaned Methods


### `v1_to_2_migrate_to_access()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/kvs/version/fixes/v1_to_2_migrate_to_access.rs` (line 14)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
use anyhow::Result;

pub async fn v1_to_2_migrate_to_access(tx: Arc<Transaction>) -> Result<()> {
	for ns in tx.all_ns().await?.iter() {
		let ns = ns.name.as_str();
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
