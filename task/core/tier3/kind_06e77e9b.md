---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 661 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 688: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
	fn test_flatbuffers_roundtrip_kind(#[case] input: Kind) {
		let mut builder = flatbuffers::FlatBufferBuilder::new();
		let input_fb = input.to_fb(&mut builder).expect("Failed to convert to FlatBuffer");
		builder.finish_minimal(input_fb);
		let buf = builder.finished_data();
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 691: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
		builder.finish_minimal(input_fb);
		let buf = builder.finished_data();
		let kind_fb = flatbuffers::root::<proto_fb::Kind>(buf).expect("Failed to read FlatBuffer");
		let kind = Kind::from_fb(kind_fb).expect("Failed to convert from FlatBuffer");
		assert_eq!(input, kind, "Roundtrip conversion failed for input: {:?}", input);
```

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 631: `#[cfg]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/protocol/flatbuffers/kind.rs` (line 631)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
	use std::collections::BTreeMap;

```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
  


### Line 686: `#[rstest]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/protocol/flatbuffers/kind.rs` (line 686)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`
