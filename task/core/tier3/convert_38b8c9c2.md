---## Orphaned Methods


### `headermap_to_object()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/api/convert.rs` (line 10)
- **Visibility**: pub(crate)
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
use crate::val::{Object, Value};

pub(crate) fn headermap_to_object(headers: HeaderMap) -> Result<Object> {
	let mut next_key = None;
	let mut next_value = Value::None;
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
