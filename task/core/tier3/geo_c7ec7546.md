---## Orphaned Methods


### `area()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/fnc/geo.rs` (line 9)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
use crate::val::{Geometry, Value};

pub fn area((arg,): (Geometry,)) -> Result<Value> {
	match arg {
		Geometry::Point(v) => Ok(v.chamberlain_duquette_unsigned_area().into()),
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `valid()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/fnc/geo.rs` (line 92)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
	use crate::val::{Geometry, Value};

	pub fn valid((arg,): (Geometry,)) -> Result<Value> {
		Ok(arg.is_valid().into())
	}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.

### `bearing()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/fnc/geo.rs` (line 25)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

pub fn bearing((v, w): (Geometry, Geometry)) -> Result<Value> {
	Ok(match (v, w) {
		(Geometry::Point(v), Geometry::Point(w)) => v.haversine_bearing(w).into(),
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
