- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: core
- **File Hash**: c5d8cef5  
- **Timestamp**: 2025-10-10T02:16:00.658134+00:00  
- **Lines of Code**: 810

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 810 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 130: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
		)
		.earliest()
		.unwrap()
		.with_timezone(&Utc);

```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 127: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
				.unwrap()
				.and_hms_nano_opt(18, 25, 43, 51_100)
				.unwrap(),
		)
		.earliest()
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)

  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 125: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
		.from_local_datetime(
			&NaiveDate::from_ymd_opt(2012, 4, 23)
				.unwrap()
				.and_hms_nano_opt(18, 25, 43, 51_100)
				.unwrap(),
```

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 781: `#[test]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/syn/parser/test/streaming.rs` (line 781)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[test]
fn test_streaming() {
	let expected = statements();
	let mut statements = StatementStream::new();
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
  

## Orphaned Methods


### `ident_field()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/syn/parser/test/streaming.rs` (line 38)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
use crate::val::{Datetime, Duration, Number, Regex, Strand, Uuid};

fn ident_field(name: &str) -> Expr {
	Expr::Idiom(Idiom(vec![Part::Field(Ident::new(name.to_string()).unwrap())]))
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
