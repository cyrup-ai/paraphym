---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 332 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

```rust
/// 2. `ft_score` field - used directly (full-text search scores)
/// 3. `score` field - used directly (generic scores)
/// 4. Rank-based fallback - `1.0 / (1.0 + rank)` if no score field is found

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `rrf()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/fnc/search.rs` (line 142)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// RETURN search::rrf([$vector_results, $text_results], 10, 60);
/// ```
pub async fn rrf(
	ctx: &Context,
	(results, limit, rrf_constant): (Array, i64, Optional<i64>),
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `linear()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/fnc/search.rs` (line 333)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// RETURN search::linear([$vector_results, $text_results], [1.0, 1.0], 10, 'zscore');
/// ```
pub async fn linear(
	ctx: &Context,
	(results, weights, limit, norm): (Array, Array, i64, String),
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
