---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 21: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

	// Expect `:/`, however `/` is part of the parsed key
	lexer.expect(':')?;
	lexer.advance_span();

```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 24: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
	lexer.advance_span();

	lexer.expect('/')?;
	lexer.scratch.push('/');

```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok.

### Line 32: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
	};

	lexer.expect(close_char)?;

	Ok(File {
```

### Action Required

## Orphaned Methods


### `file()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/syn/lexer/compound/file.rs` (line 8)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
use crate::val::File;

pub fn file(lexer: &mut Lexer, start: Token) -> Result<File, SyntaxError> {
	let close_char = match start.kind {
		t!("f\"") => '"',
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
