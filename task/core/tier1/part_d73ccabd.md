---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 604 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

```rust
	Lookup(Lookup),
	Value(Expr),
	/// TODO: Remove, start and move it out of part to elimite invalid state.
	Start(Expr),
	Method(String, Vec<Expr>),
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

  - TODO
  - 

```rust
	/// that field was removed.
	///
	/// TODO: Remove this method once we work out the kinks with removing
	/// `Part::Index(x)` and only having `Part::Value(x)`
