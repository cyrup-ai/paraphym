- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: core
- **File Hash**: 75bfddd5

- **Lines of Code**: 609

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 609 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 218: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
		SurValue::Uuid(uuid) => GqlValue::String(uuid.to_string()),
		SurValue::Array(a) => {
			GqlValue::List(a.into_iter().map(|v| sql_value_to_gql_value(v).unwrap()).collect())
		}
		SurValue::Object(o) => GqlValue::Object(
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 222: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
		SurValue::Object(o) => GqlValue::Object(
			o.0.into_iter()
				.map(|(k, v)| (Name::new(k), sql_value_to_gql_value(v).unwrap()))
				.collect(),

### Line 256: `.unwrap()`

```rust
		Kind::Record(mut r) => match r.len() {
			0 => TypeRef::named("record"),
