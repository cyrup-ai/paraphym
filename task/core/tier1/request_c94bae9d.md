- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: core
- **File Hash**: c94bae9d  
- **Timestamp**: 2025-10-10T02:16:00.670128+00:00  
- **Lines of Code**: 530

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 530 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 462
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
		self.init.referrer.clone()
	}
	// TODO

	// ------------------------------
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.


- Line 499
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
			let key = HeaderName::from_static("content-type");
			let types = headers.get_all(key);
			// TODO: This is not according to spec.
			types
				.iter()

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 541: `#[cfg]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/fnc/script/fetch/classes/request.rs` (line 541)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
	use js::CatchResultExt;
	use js::promise::Promise;
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
  


### Line 548: `#[tokio :: test]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/fnc/script/fetch/classes/request.rs` (line 548)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

	#[tokio::test]
	async fn basic_request_use() {
		create_test_context!(ctx => {
			ctx.eval::<Promise,_>(r#"
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
