---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 60
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
	let opt = opt.dive(4)?;

	//TODO: Maybe check memory usage?

	let instant_start = Instant::now();
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 66: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

	// Create a JavaScript context
	let run = js::AsyncRuntime::new().unwrap();
	// Explicitly set max stack size to 256 KiB
	run.set_max_stack_size(*SCRIPTING_MAX_STACK_SIZE).await;
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 76: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
	run.set_interrupt_handler(Some(handler)).await;
	// Create an execution context
	let ctx = js::AsyncContext::full(&run).await.unwrap();
	// Set the module resolver and loader
	run.set_loader(resolver(), loader()).await;
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok.

  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 39: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
			pending: RefCell::new(None),
		})
		.expect("userdata shouldn't be in use");

		Ok(())
```

## Orphaned Methods


### `create_query_data()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/fnc/script/main.rs` (line 23)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Caller must ensure that the runtime from which `Ctx` originates cannot
/// outlife 'a.
pub unsafe fn create_query_data<'a>(
	context: &'a Context,
	opt: &'a Options,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
