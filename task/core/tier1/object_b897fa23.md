- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `from_entries()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/fnc/object.rs` (line 21)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

pub fn from_entries((array,): (Array,)) -> Result<Value> {
	let mut obj: BTreeMap<String, Value> = BTreeMap::default();

```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `entries()`

```rust
use crate::val::{Array, Object, Strand, Value};

pub fn entries((object,): (Object,)) -> Result<Value> {
	Ok(Value::Array(Array(
		object
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
