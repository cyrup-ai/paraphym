- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: core
- **File Hash**: 26745b90

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 338 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 27
  - TODO

```rust
	///
	/// This variant should not contain Field::All
	/// TODO: Encode the above variant into the type.
	Value(Box<Field>),
	/// Normal fields where an object with the selected fields is expected
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

```rust
		// Process the desired output

		// TODO: This makes it so that with selection `SELECT 1 as foo,*,bar` if `foo`
		// is in the document it will be overwritten with 1. It might be slightly more
		// usefull to have the ordering matter and make `1 as foo,*` provide the foo

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 197: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
							// Assign each fetched yield to the output
							for (p, x) in res {
								match p.last().unwrap().alias() {
									// This is an alias expression part
									Some(a) => {
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
