```rust
	pub fn tee(&mut self) -> (ReadableStream<R>, impl Future<Output = ()> + use<R>) {
		// replace the stream with a channel driven by as task.
		// TODO: figure out how backpressure works in the stream API.

		// Unbounded, otherwise when one channel gets awaited it might block forever
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
