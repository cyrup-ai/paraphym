---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 311 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 149
  - FIXME
  - 

```rust
	{
		let mut i = 0;
		// FIXME: use drain_filter once stabilized (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43244)
		// to avoid negation of the predicate return value.
		self.retain(|_| {
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 365: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
		// We know there is at least one element in the array therefore iters is not
		// empty. This is safe.
		let longest_length = iters.iter().map(|i| i.len()).max().unwrap();
		for _ in 0..longest_length {
			transposed_vec.push(
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
