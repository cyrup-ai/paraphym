```rust
		body: ApiBody,
	) -> Result<Option<(ApiResponse, ResponseInstruction)>> {
		// TODO: Figure out if it is possible if multiple actions can have the same
		// method, and if so should they all be run?
		let method_action = api.actions.iter().find(|x| x.methods.contains(&self.method));
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

```rust
		let Some(action) = method_action.map(|x| &x.action).or(api.fallback.as_ref()) else {
			// condition already checked above.
			// either method_action is some or api fallback is some.
			unreachable!()
