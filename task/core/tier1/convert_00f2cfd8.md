- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: core
- **File Hash**: 00f2cfd8  
- **Timestamp**: 2025-10-10T02:16:00.663886+00:00  
- **Lines of Code**: 566

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 566 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 188
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
				// A literal table
				TAG_TABLE => match *v {
					// TODO: Null byte validitY
					CborValue::Text(v) => Ok(val::Value::Table(Table::new(v).unwrap())),
					_ => Err("Expected a CBOR text data type"),
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 189: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
				TAG_TABLE => match *v {
					// TODO: Null byte validitY
					CborValue::Text(v) => Ok(val::Value::Table(Table::new(v).unwrap())),
					_ => Err("Expected a CBOR text data type"),
				},
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "

## Orphaned Methods


### `from_uuid()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/core/src/rpc/format/cbor/convert.rs` (line 592)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

fn from_uuid(val: Uuid) -> CborValue {
	CborValue::Tag(TAG_SPEC_UUID, Box::new(CborValue::Bytes(val.into_bytes().into())))
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
