---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 595 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 671
  - would require
  - 

```rust
	/// Check if the indexing process is aborting.
	async fn is_aborted(&self) -> bool {
		// We use `Ordering::Relaxed` as there are no shared data that would require any
		// synchronization. This method is only called by the single thread building
		// the index.
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
