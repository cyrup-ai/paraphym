```rust
	pub ac: Ident,
	pub base: Option<Base>,
	// TODO: Merge these booleans into a enum as having them both be false is invalid state.
	pub expired: bool,
	pub revoked: bool,
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
