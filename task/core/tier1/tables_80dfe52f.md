---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 548 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 274
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
								}
							};
							// TODO: Parse record id.
							let thing = match id.clone().try_into() {
								Ok(t) => t,
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 524: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
	}

	let (k, v) = filter.iter().next().unwrap();

	match k.as_str().to_lowercase().as_str() {
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 612: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
	let lhs = Expr::Idiom(field_name.intox());

	let (k, v) = obj.iter().next().unwrap();
	let op = parse_op(k)?;

```

### Line 467: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
		Kind::Record(ts) => match ts.len() {
			1 => TypeRef::named(filter_name_from_table(
				ts.first().expect("ts should have exactly one element").as_str(),
			)),
			_ => TypeRef::named(TypeRef::ID),
```
