---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 347 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 395
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
		// Check to see if transaction is writable
		ensure!(self.write, Error::TxReadonly);
		// TODO: Check if we need savepoint with ranges

		// Delete the key range
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 39
  - actual
  - 

```rust
	save_points: SavePoints,
	// The above, supposedly 'static transaction
	// actually points here, so we need to ensure
	// the memory is kept alive. This pointer must
	// be declared last, so that it is dropped last.
```
