---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 537 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 53
  - hardcoded URL
  - 

```rust
                app_password: None,
                team_id: None,
                timestamp_url: String::from("http://timestamp.apple.com/ts01"),
            }
        }
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 387: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        async fn create_notarization_zip(&self, bundle_path: &Path) -> Result<PathBuf, BundleError> {
            let zip_name = format!("{}.zip", path_utils::file_stem_str(bundle_path).unwrap_or("bundle"));
            let zip_path = bundle_path.parent().unwrap().join(zip_name);
            
            let output = Command::new("ditto")
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
