---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 555 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

```rust

                azure_tenant_id: None,
                timestamp_url: String::from("http://timestamp.digicert.com"),
                digest_algorithm: DigestAlgorithm::Sha256,
                sign_tool_path: None,
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
