---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 548 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Orphaned Methods


### `decode_sixel_events()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/packages/sixel6vt/src/sixel_region/mod.rs` (line 614)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// A convenience function for decoding a slice of SixelEvents with the region-based approach.
pub fn decode_sixel_events(events: &[SixelEvent], max_width: Option<usize>, max_height: Option<usize>) -> Result<SixelImage, SixelError> {
    let mut decoder = SixelDecoder::new();
    if let Some(w) = max_width {
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
