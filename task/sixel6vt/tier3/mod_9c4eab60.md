---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 415 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 661
  - Fall back
  - 

```rust
    
    // If initial region count is very high, the geometric merge will be too slow
    // Fall back to column-based encoder for complex images with many regions
    if regions.len() > 10_000 {
        tracing::debug!(
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

  - fallback
  - 

```rust
/// Column-based encoding - O(w*h) complexity, reliable for all image types
/// 
/// This is the proven reference implementation used as fallback for large or 
/// complex images where geometric encoding would be too slow.
/// This approach processes the image column-by-column with run-length encoding.
```

## Orphaned Methods


### `find_dominant_color()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/packages/sixel6vt/src/renderer/mod.rs` (line 540)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// assert_eq!(find_dominant_color(&colors), 1);
/// ```
fn find_dominant_color(colors: &[u16]) -> u16 {
    let mut counts = [0u8; 16];
    
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
