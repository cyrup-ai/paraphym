# INPROD_12: Image Processing Pipeline Implementation

## SEVERITY: HIGH

## OBJECTIVE
Implement actual image processing in the image builder instead of just returning the load stream without any processing.

## LOCATION
- `packages/candle/src/builders/image.rs`

## CURRENT STATE
- Line 222: `// For now, just return the load stream`
- Processing closure is accepted but never applied
- No actual image transformation occurs

## SUBTASK 1: Apply Processing Function to Stream
- Locate image.rs:222 in the process method
- Apply the processing closure F to each ImageChunk in the stream
- Transform chunks using the provided function
- Return the processed stream instead of just the load stream

## SUBTASK 2: Handle Processing Errors
- Catch and handle errors from the processing closure
- Propagate errors appropriately through the stream
- Maintain stream semantics during processing

## SUBTASK 3: Support Common Image Operations
- Ensure ImageChunk type supports necessary transformations
- Enable resize, crop, filter operations through the closure
- Maintain image data integrity during processing

## DEFINITION OF DONE
- [ ] Processing closure is actually applied to image chunks
- [ ] Transformed chunks are returned in the stream
- [ ] Processing errors are handled correctly
- [ ] Stub comment and TODO removed
- [ ] Image transformations work as expected

## RESEARCH NOTES
- Review ImageChunk structure and available data
- Check for existing image processing utilities in the codebase
- Examine stream transformation patterns
- Look at how chunks flow through the pipeline

## CONSTRAINTS
- NO test code to be written (separate team responsibility)
- NO benchmark code to be written (separate team responsibility)
- Focus solely on ./src implementation
