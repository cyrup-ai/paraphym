```rust
        pub mime_type: Option<String>,

        /// The text of the item. This must only be set if the item can actually be represented as text (not binary data).
        #[serde(rename = "text")]
        pub text: String,
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `panic_if_key_missing()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/plugins/eval-sh/src/pdk.rs` (line 4)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

#[allow(unused)]
fn panic_if_key_missing() -> ! {
    panic!("missing key");
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
