# INPROD_16: Quantum Entanglement Bonds Implementation

## SEVERITY: MEDIUM

## OBJECTIVE
Implement actual quantum signature bond modification instead of just logging and returning success.

## LOCATION
- `packages/candle/src/domain/memory/cognitive/types.rs`

## CURRENT STATE
- Line 1091: `// we'll implement this by creating a log entry and returning success for now`
- Entanglement bonds are not actually created or modified
- Method just logs and returns true without changing quantum signature state

## SUBTASK 1: Implement Bond Creation
- Locate cognitive/types.rs:1091
- Actually modify the quantum signature's entanglement_bonds
- Use create_entanglement_bond method with proper mutable access
- Store the bond in the quantum signature state

## SUBTASK 2: Handle Mutability Requirements
- Ensure proper mutable access to quantum signature
- Either: Refactor to accept &mut self, or
- Use interior mutability (RefCell, RwLock), or
- Return a modified quantum signature
- Choose approach that fits the architecture

## SUBTASK 3: Verify Bond Integrity
- Validate bond strength and coherence values
- Ensure bond is properly linked between nodes
- Check that bond targets exist

## DEFINITION OF DONE
- [ ] Quantum signature bonds are actually created and stored
- [ ] Mutability issues are resolved
- [ ] Bond integrity is validated
- [ ] No log-only stub remains
- [ ] Actual state changes occur

## RESEARCH NOTES
- Review QuantumSignature structure and entanglement_bonds field
- Examine create_entanglement_bond method signature
- Check for interior mutability patterns in cognitive types
- Review how quantum signatures are used and accessed

## CONSTRAINTS
- NO test code to be written (separate team responsibility)
- NO benchmark code to be written (separate team responsibility)
- Focus solely on ./src implementation
