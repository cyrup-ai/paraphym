---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 20
  - stubby variable name
  - mock_origin

```rust
pub mod cert;

pub mod mock_origin;
pub mod server_utils;
pub mod websocket;
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 30: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Should use .expect() with descriptive message in tests

```rust
// will no longer be associated with the backing pool fds since it's dropped per test
pub static GLOBAL_RUNTIME: Lazy<Runtime> =
    Lazy::new(|| Builder::new_multi_thread().enable_all().build().unwrap());

pub fn conf_dir() -> String {
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "

## Orphaned Methods


### `conf_dir()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/pingora/pingora-proxy/tests/utils/mod.rs` (line 32)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
    Lazy::new(|| Builder::new_multi_thread().enable_all().build().unwrap());

pub fn conf_dir() -> String {
    format!("{}/tests/utils/conf", env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"))
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
