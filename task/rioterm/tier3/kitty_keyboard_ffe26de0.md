---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 374 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 161
  - Fallback
  - 

```rust
            Some(SequenceBase::new(payload.into(), SequenceTerminator::Kitty))
        } else if self.kitty_encode_all && associated_text.is_some() {
            // Fallback when need to report text, but we don't have any key associated with this
            // text.
            Some(SequenceBase::new("0".into(), SequenceTerminator::Kitty))
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

  - actual
  - 

```rust
        // NOTE: Kitty's protocol mandates that the modifier state is applied before
        // key press, however winit sends them after the key press, so for modifiers
        // itself apply the state based on keysyms and not the _actual_ modifiers
        // state, which is how kitty is doing so and what is suggested in such case.
        let press = key.state.is_pressed();
```

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 130: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        if character.chars().count() == 1 {
            let shift = self.modifiers.contains(SequenceModifiers::SHIFT);
            let ch = character.chars().next().unwrap();
            let unshifted_ch = if shift {
                ch.to_lowercase().next().unwrap()
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 132: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            let ch = character.chars().next().unwrap();
            let unshifted_ch = if shift {
                ch.to_lowercase().next().unwrap()
            } else {
                ch
```

### Line 464: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    // 0x7f (DEL) is included here since it has a dedicated control code (`^?`) which generally
    // does not match the reported text (`^H`), despite not technically being part of C0 or C1.
    let codepoint = text.bytes().next().unwrap();
    text.len() == 1 && (codepoint < 0x20 || (0x7f..=0x9f).contains(&codepoint))
}
```
