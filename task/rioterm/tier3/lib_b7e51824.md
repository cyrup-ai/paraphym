---## Orphaned Methods


### `inject_sixel()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/frontends/rioterm/src/lib.rs` (line 36)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Inject sixel data directly into the terminal for rendering
/// This processes the data through the terminal's parser as if it came from the PTY
pub fn inject_sixel(app: &mut Application, sixel_data: &str) {
    for route in app.router.routes.values_mut() {
        // Get the terminal from the current context
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
