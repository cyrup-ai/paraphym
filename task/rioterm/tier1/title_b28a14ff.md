- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 95: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    let mut new_template = template.to_owned();

    let re = regex::Regex::new(r"\{\{(.*?)\}\}").unwrap();
    for (to_replace_str, [variable]) in re.captures_iter(template).map(|c| c.extract()) {
        let variables = if to_replace_str.contains("||") {
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 218: `#[cfg]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/frontends/rioterm/src/context/title.rs` (line 218)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
pub mod test {
    use super::*;
    use crate::context::create_mock_context;
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
  


### Line 228: `#[test]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/frontends/rioterm/src/context/title.rs` (line 228)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

    #[test]
    fn test_update_title() {
        let context_dimension = ContextDimension::build(
            1200.0,
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`

### Line 279: `#[test]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/frontends/rioterm/src/context/title.rs` (line 279)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

    #[test]
    fn test_update_title_with_logical_or() {
        let context_dimension = ContextDimension::build(
            1200.0,
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
