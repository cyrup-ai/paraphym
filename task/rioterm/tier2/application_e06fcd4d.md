- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: rioterm
- **File Hash**: e06fcd4d  
- **Timestamp**: 2025-10-10T02:15:58.902263+00:00  
- **Lines of Code**: 1290

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 1290 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 2 (possible) Infractions 


- Line 1442
  - placeholder
  - 

```rust

        // SAFETY: The clipboard must be dropped before the event loop, so use the nop clipboard
        // as a safe placeholder.
        self.router.clipboard =
            std::rc::Rc::new(std::cell::RefCell::new(Clipboard::new_nop()));
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 326
  - actual
  - 

```rust

                        // Mark the renderable content as needing to check for damage
                        // The actual damage retrieval will happen during render
                        if let Some(ctx_item) =
                            route.window.screen.ctx_mut().get_mut(route_id)
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 49: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        // which is done in `loop_exiting`.
        let clipboard =
            unsafe { Clipboard::new(event_loop.display_handle().unwrap().as_raw()) };

        let mut router = Router::new(config.fonts.to_owned(), clipboard);
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
