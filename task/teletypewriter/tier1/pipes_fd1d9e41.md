## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 139: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            Ok(err) => {
                // Other thread will be closing
                self.thread.take().unwrap().join().unwrap();
                return Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::BrokenPipe, err));
            }
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
