    // Lint failure is spurious; it's because winapi's definition of PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_LIST
    // implies it is one pointer in size (32 or 64 bits) but really this is just a dummy value.
    // Casting a *mut u8 (pointer to 8 bit type) might therefore not be aligned correctly in
    // the compiler's eyes.
```

- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
