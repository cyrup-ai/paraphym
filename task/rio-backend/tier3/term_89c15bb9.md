///
/// The color range of a 256 color terminal consists of 4 parts,
/// often 5, in which case you actually get 258 colors:
///
/// Color numbers 0 to 7 are the default terminal colors, the actual RGB
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
