# INPROD_15: Document Context Provider Implementation

## SEVERITY: HIGH

## OBJECTIVE
Implement actual file reading and document creation in the context provider instead of returning placeholder documents.

## LOCATION
- `packages/candle/src/domain/context/provider.rs`

## CURRENT STATE
- Line 658: `// For now, create a basic document structure`
- File reading not implemented
- Returns hardcoded format string instead of actual file content

## SUBTASK 1: Implement File Reading
- Locate provider.rs:658 in document creation
- Actually read the file at context.path
- Handle file reading errors appropriately
- Load file content into memory

## SUBTASK 2: Create Proper Document Structure
- Parse file content based on file type
- Create Document with actual content data
- Set appropriate metadata (file path, size, modified time)
- Handle different document formats if needed

## SUBTASK 3: Handle File Types
- Support text files
- Support structured formats (JSON, YAML, etc.) if applicable
- Set document type/format appropriately
- Handle binary files or unsupported types gracefully

## DEFINITION OF DONE
- [ ] Files are actually read from disk
- [ ] Document contains real file content
- [ ] File reading errors are handled
- [ ] Different file types are supported
- [ ] Placeholder format string is removed
- [ ] Stub comment removed

## RESEARCH NOTES
- Review Document structure and required fields
- Check context.path format and expectations
- Examine file reading patterns in the codebase
- Look for existing document parsers or loaders

## CONSTRAINTS
- NO test code to be written (separate team responsibility)
- NO benchmark code to be written (separate team responsibility)
- Focus solely on ./src implementation
