# INPROD_19: FireCracker Backend Execution

## SEVERITY: MEDIUM

## OBJECTIVE
Implement actual FireCracker API integration for VM code execution instead of placeholder logic.

## LOCATION
- `packages/cylo/src/backends/firecracker.rs`

## CURRENT STATE
- Line 916: `// In a real implementation, we would:`
- Comment lists steps: 1. Use FireCracker API, 2. Monitor execution
- Execution is not actually performed
- VM integration is completely stubbed

## SUBTASK 1: Implement FireCracker API Integration
- Locate firecracker.rs:916
- Use FireCracker API to send execution commands to VM
- Prepare execution script as shown in prepare_execution_script
- Send commands through FireCracker control interface

## SUBTASK 2: Monitor VM Execution
- Monitor execution via VM console or agent
- Capture stdout and stderr from VM
- Track execution status and completion
- Handle execution timeouts

## SUBTASK 3: Return Execution Results
- Collect output from VM execution
- Parse results and errors
- Return proper ExecutionResult with output and status
- Clean up VM resources after execution

## DEFINITION OF DONE
- [ ] FireCracker API is used to execute code in VM
- [ ] Execution is monitored and output captured
- [ ] Results are returned with proper status
- [ ] VM resources are cleaned up
- [ ] Stub comment removed

## RESEARCH NOTES
- Review FireCracker API documentation and control interface
- Check for existing FireCracker client libraries in dependencies
- Examine prepare_execution_script implementation
- Look for VM communication patterns in the codebase

## CONSTRAINTS
- NO test code to be written (separate team responsibility)
- NO benchmark code to be written (separate team responsibility)
- Focus solely on ./src implementation
