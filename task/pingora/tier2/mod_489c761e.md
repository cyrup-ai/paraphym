- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `test_context()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/pingora/src/normalize/mod.rs` (line 53)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Create a protocol context for testing
pub fn test_context(protocol: Proto) -> ProtocolContext {
    ProtocolContext::new(protocol, uuid::Uuid::new_v4().to_string())
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `normalize_to_jsonrpc()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/pingora/src/normalize/mod.rs` (line 27)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Convenience function to normalize any protocol to JSON-RPC
pub fn normalize_to_jsonrpc(
    user: &str,
    body: &[u8],
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.

pub fn denormalize_from_jsonrpc(
    ctx: &ProtocolContext,
    response: &serde_json::Value,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
