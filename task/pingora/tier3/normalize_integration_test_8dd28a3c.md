```rust
    let request_id = "test-123";

    // Test with no upstream URL (should use fallback schema)
    let result = graphql_to_json_rpc_with_schema(
        query,
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

        assert!(type_info.possible_types.is_empty());
        // Fields are empty in fallback schema (no introspection data available)

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 40: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Should use .expect() with descriptive message in tests

```rust

    assert!(result.is_ok());
    let json_rpc = result.unwrap();

    // Verify JSON-RPC structure
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 74: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Should use .expect() with descriptive message in tests

```rust

    assert!(result.is_ok());
    let json_rpc = result.unwrap();

    // Verify the fragment was processed (even with basic schema)
```
