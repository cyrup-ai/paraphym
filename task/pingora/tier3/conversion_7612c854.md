---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 314 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `to_json_rpc()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/pingora/src/normalize/conversion.rs` (line 22)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Normalize incoming protocol to JSON-RPC for cyrup-mcp-api
pub fn to_json_rpc(_user: &str, body: &[u8]) -> Result<(ProtocolContext, Value)> {
    to_json_rpc_with_headers(_user, body, None)
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `validate_json_rpc()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/pingora/src/normalize/conversion.rs` (line 376)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Validate JSON-RPC structure
pub fn validate_json_rpc(value: &Value) -> ConversionResult<()> {
    // Check required fields
    if !value.is_object() {
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
