- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `run()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/pingora/src/mcp_bridge.rs` (line 14)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

// Run the MCP bridge that processes incoming messages
pub async fn run(mut rx: mpsc::Receiver<BridgeMsg>) {
    info!("MCP bridge started and ready to process messages");

```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
