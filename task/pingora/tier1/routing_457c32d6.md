- **Project**: pingora
- **File Hash**: 457c32d6

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 327 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

```rust
                            let use_tls = service.upstream_urls
                                .get(addr)
                                .map(|url| url.starts_with("https://"))
                                .unwrap_or(addr.port() == 443);
                            
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
