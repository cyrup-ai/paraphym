- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: daemon
- **File Hash**: 0a1afcc1  
- **Timestamp**: 2025-10-10T02:15:59.688248+00:00  
- **Lines of Code**: 494

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 494 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Orphaned Methods


### `format_scan_results()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/security/audit.rs` (line 672)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

    /// Format scan results for CI/CD output
    pub fn format_scan_results(result: &AuditResult) -> ArrayString<1024> {
        let mut output = ArrayString::new();

```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `should_fail_build()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/security/audit.rs` (line 647)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

    /// Check if vulnerabilities exceed CI/CD thresholds
    pub fn should_fail_build(scanner: &VulnerabilityScanner, result: &AuditResult) -> bool {
        scanner.thresholds_exceeded(result)
    }
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.

### `default_padding()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/security/audit.rs` (line 57)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Default padding for cache-line alignment
fn default_padding() -> [u8; 64] {
    [0; 64]
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `generate_failure_message()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/security/audit.rs` (line 652)

```rust

    /// Generate CI/CD failure message
    pub fn generate_failure_message(
        result: &AuditResult,
        _thresholds: &AuditThresholds,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
