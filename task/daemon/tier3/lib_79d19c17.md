---## Orphaned Methods


### `detect()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/tool_integration/examples/claude-desktop/src/lib.rs` (line 61)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

#[plugin_fn]
pub fn detect(_: ()) -> FnResult<Json<DetectedTool>> {
    let config_path = get_config_path_internal();
    let path = std::path::Path::new(&config_path);
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
