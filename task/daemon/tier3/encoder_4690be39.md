---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 38: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        // Add event type if present
        if let Some(ref event_type) = event.event_type {
            writeln!(output, "event: {}", event_type).expect("String write cannot fail");
        }

```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 43: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        // Add data field(s) - handle multiline data properly
        for line in event.data.lines() {
            writeln!(output, "data: {}", line).expect("String write cannot fail");
        }

```

### Line 48: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        // Add event ID if present
        if let Some(ref id) = event.id {
            writeln!(output, "id: {}", id).expect("String write cannot fail");
        }

## Orphaned Methods


### `escape_sse_data()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/service/sse/encoder.rs` (line 83)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// we ensure proper line handling and Unicode preservation.
#[allow(dead_code)]
fn escape_sse_data(data: &str) -> String {
    // SSE data doesn't need escaping except for proper line handling
    // Unicode is preserved as-is since SSE is UTF-8
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
