---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 74: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            "--strict",
            "--verbose=2",
            binary_path.to_str().unwrap(),
        ])
        .output()
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 116: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            "-k",
            "--keepParent",
            config.binary_path.to_str().unwrap(),
            zip_path.to_str().unwrap(),
        ])
```

```rust

        .args(["stapler", "staple", binary_path.to_str().unwrap()])
        .output()
        .context("Failed to staple notarization ticket")?;

## Orphaned Methods


### `cleanup_keychain()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/signing/macos.rs` (line 288)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Clean up temporary keychain
#[allow(dead_code)] // Advanced certificate management API
pub fn cleanup_keychain() -> Result<()> {
    if let Ok(keychain_name) = env::var("SWEETMCP_TEMP_KEYCHAIN") {
        let _ = Command::new("security")
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `import_certificate()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/signing/macos.rs` (line 192)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Import a certificate from file for signing
#[allow(dead_code)] // Advanced certificate management API
pub fn import_certificate(cert_path: &Path, password: Option<&str>) -> Result<String> {
    // Create temporary keychain
    let keychain_name = format!("sweetmcp-signing-{}.keychain", std::process::id());
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
