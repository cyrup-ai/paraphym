- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: daemon
- **File Hash**: bb23c324

- **Lines of Code**: 319

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 319 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 365: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            ),
        )
        .unwrap();
        signal::sigaction(
            Signal::SIGTERM,
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 374: `.unwrap()`

## Orphaned Methods


### `check_signals()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/manager.rs` (line 379)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Non‑blocking check – returns Some(signal) once.
fn check_signals() -> Option<nix::sys::signal::Signal> {
    use std::sync::atomic::Ordering::*;

```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `handler()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/manager.rs` (line 353)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
pub fn install_signal_handlers() {
    use nix::sys::signal::{self, Signal};
    extern "C" fn handler(sig: i32) {
        RECEIVED_SIGNAL.store(sig as usize, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst);
    }
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
