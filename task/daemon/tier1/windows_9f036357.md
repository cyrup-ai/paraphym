- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 97: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            "/pa", // Default Authenticode verification
            "/v",  // Verbose
            binary_path.to_str().unwrap(),
        ])
        .output()
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 178: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            "-d",
            &description,
            config.binary_path.to_str().unwrap(),
        ])
        .output()

### Line 218: `.unwrap()`

```rust
            password,
            "-importpfx",
            cert_path.to_str().unwrap(),
        ])

## Orphaned Methods


### `import_certificate_from_base64()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/signing/windows.rs` (line 193)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Import a certificate from base64 string (for CI/CD)
pub fn import_certificate_from_base64(base64_cert: &str, password: &str) -> Result<String> {
    use std::io::Write;

```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `sign_with_azure()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/daemon/src/signing/windows.rs` (line 153)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Sign using Azure Code Signing (Trusted Signing)
pub fn sign_with_azure(
    config: &SigningConfig,
    endpoint: &str,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
