---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 531 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

- Line 221
  - stubby method name
  - temp_dir

```rust

        // Create unique helper path in temp directory
        let temp_dir = std::env::temp_dir();
        let helper_name = format!("SweetMCPHelper_{}.exe", std::process::id());
        let helper_path = temp_dir.join(helper_name);
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
