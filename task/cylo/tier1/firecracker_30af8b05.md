---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 418 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 425
  - stubby variable name
  - tmp_dir

```rust

        // Create a temporary file with the code
        let tmp_dir = "/tmp";
        let file_name = format!(
            "code-{}-{}.{}",
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

  - stubby variable name
  - tmp_dir

```rust
            Self::get_file_extension(language)
        );
        let file_path = format!("{tmp_dir}/{file_name}");

        let mut file = File::create(&file_path)?;
