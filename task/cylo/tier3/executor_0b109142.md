---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 462 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

```rust
    /// Balance performance and security
    Balanced,
    /// Use specific backend if available, fallback to balanced
    PreferBackend(String),
    /// Only use explicitly specified backends
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `create_security_executor()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/cylo/src/executor.rs` (line 668)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Create a security-focused executor
#[inline]
pub fn create_security_executor() -> CyloExecutor {
    CyloExecutor::with_strategy(RoutingStrategy::Security)
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `create_performance_executor()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/cylo/src/executor.rs` (line 662)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Create a performance-optimized executor
#[inline]
pub fn create_performance_executor() -> CyloExecutor {
    CyloExecutor::with_strategy(RoutingStrategy::Performance)
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `execute_with_routing()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/cylo/src/executor.rs` (line 674)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Execute code with automatic backend selection and optimal routing
#[inline]
pub fn execute_with_routing(code: &str, language: &str) -> AsyncTask<CyloResult<ExecutionResult>> {
    let executor = create_executor();
    executor.execute_code(code, language)
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `global_executor()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/cylo/src/executor.rs` (line 684)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Get the global executor instance
#[inline]
pub fn global_executor() -> &'static CyloExecutor {
    GLOBAL_EXECUTOR.get_or_init(CyloExecutor::new)
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `init_global_executor()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/cylo/src/executor.rs` (line 689)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Initialize global executor with specific configuration
pub fn init_global_executor(executor: CyloExecutor) -> Result<(), CyloError> {
    GLOBAL_EXECUTOR.set(executor)
        .map_err(|_| CyloError::internal("Global executor already initialized".to_string()))
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
