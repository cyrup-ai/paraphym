---## Orphaned Methods


### `watch_directory()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/cylo/src/watcher.rs` (line 42)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

// Event-based file watcher using watchexec
pub fn watch_directory(path: PathBuf, tx: mpsc::Sender<PipelineEvent>) -> Result<(), StorageError> {
    info!("Starting file watcher for directory: {}", path.display());

```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
