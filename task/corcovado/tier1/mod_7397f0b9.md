---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 176
  - TODO
  - 

```rust

unsafe fn no_notify_on_instant_completion(handle: HANDLE) -> io::Result<()> {
    // TODO: move those to winapi
    const FILE_SKIP_COMPLETION_PORT_ON_SUCCESS: u32 = 0x1;

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 37
  - actual
  - 

```rust
//! Currently all of these low-level operations are housed in a separate `miow`
//! crate to provide a 0-cost abstraction over IOCP. This crate uses that to
//! implement all fiddly bits so there's very few actual Windows API calls or
//! `unsafe` blocks as a result.
//!
```

- Line 98
  - actual
  - 

```rust
//! To manage all this the `Selector` uses the `OVERLAPPED` pointer from the
//! completion status. The selector assumes that all `OVERLAPPED` pointers are
//! actually pointers to the interior of a `selector::Overlapped` which means
//! that right after the `OVERLAPPED` itself there's a function pointer. This
//! function pointer is given the completion status as well as another callback

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 181: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    let flags = FILE_SKIP_COMPLETION_PORT_ON_SUCCESS | FILE_SKIP_SET_EVENT_ON_HANDLE;

    let r = SetFileCompletionNotificationModes(handle, flags.try_into().unwrap());
    if r == 1 {
        Ok(())
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
