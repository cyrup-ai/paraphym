---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 337 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 324
  - TODO
  - 

```rust

            if token == awakener {
                // TODO: Should this return an error if event is an error. It
                // is not critical as spurious wakeups are permitted.
                ret = true;
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 210
  - actual
  - 

```rust
        unsafe {
            // EV_RECEIPT is a nice way to apply changes and get back per-event results while not
            // draining the actual changes.
            let filter = libc::EV_DELETE | libc::EV_RECEIPT;
            #[cfg(not(target_os = "netbsd"))]
```

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 394: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    let kq = unsafe { libc::kqueue() };
    let kqf = EventedFd(&kq);
    let poll = Poll::new().unwrap();

    // registering kqueue fd will fail if write is requested (On anything but some versions of OS
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 404: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        PollOpt::edge() | PollOpt::oneshot(),
    )
    .unwrap();
}

```

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 388: `#[test]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/corcovado/src/sys/unix/kqueue.rs` (line 388)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[test]
fn does_not_register_rw() {
    use unix::EventedFd;
    use {Poll, PollOpt, Ready, Token};
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions

#[test]
fn test_coalesce_aio() {
    let mut events = Events::with_capacity(1);
    events
