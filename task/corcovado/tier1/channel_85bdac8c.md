- **File Hash**: 85bdac8c

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 310 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 103
  - would require
  - 

```rust
    Io(io::Error),

    /// Data could not be sent because it would require the callee to block.
    Full(T),

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.


- Line 288
  - TODO
  - 

```rust

        if self.inner.pending.load(Ordering::Relaxed) > 0 {
            // TODO: Don't drop readiness
            let _ = set_readiness.set_readiness(Ready::readable());
        }
```

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 294: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        self.registration
            .fill(registration)
            .expect("unexpected state encountered");
        self.inner
            .set_readiness
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
