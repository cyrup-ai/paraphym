```rust

// Set non-blocking (workaround since the std version doesn't work in fuchsia)
// TODO: fix the std version and replace this
pub fn set_nonblock(fd: RawFd) -> io::Result<()> {
    cvt(unsafe { libc::fcntl(fd, libc::F_SETFL, libc::O_NONBLOCK) }).map(|_| ())
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 155: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

    fn inner_ref(&self) -> &T {
        self.0.as_ref().unwrap()
    }

```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 159: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

    fn inner_mut(&mut self) -> &mut T {
        self.0.as_mut().unwrap()
    }
}
