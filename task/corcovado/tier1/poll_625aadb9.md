---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 1109 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 1088: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        if 0 != curr {
            // Enter slower path
            let mut lock = self.lock.lock().unwrap();
            let mut inc = false;

```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 1145: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 2861: `#[test]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/corcovado/src/poll.rs` (line 2861)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust
#[test]
#[cfg(all(unix, not(target_os = "fuchsia")))]
pub fn as_raw_fd() {
    let poll = Poll::new().unwrap();
    assert!(poll.as_raw_fd() > 0);
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
