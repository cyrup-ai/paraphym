```rust
// See below for the usage of SOCK_CLOEXEC, but this constant is only defined on
// Linux currently (e.g. support doesn't exist on other platforms). In order to
// get name resolution to work and things to compile we just define a dummy
// SOCK_CLOEXEC here for other platforms. Note that the dummy constant isn't
// actually ever used (the blocks below are wrapped in `if cfg!` as well.
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
