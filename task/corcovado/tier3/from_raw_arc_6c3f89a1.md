```rust
//!
//! This module contains a copy of the `Arc` found in the standard library,
//! stripped down to the bare bones of what we actually need. The reason this is
//! done is for the ability to concretely know the memory layout of the `Inner`
//! structure of the arc pointer itself (e.g. `ArcInner` in the standard
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

```rust
//! standard library:
//!
//! * The size of `FromRawArc` is actually two words because of the drop flag
//! * The compiler doesn't understand that the pointer in `FromRawArc` is never
//!   null, so Option<FromRawArc<T>> is not a nullable pointer.

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 98: `#[cfg]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/corcovado/src/sys/windows/from_raw_arc.rs` (line 98)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::FromRawArc;

```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
  


### Line 102: `#[test]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/corcovado/src/sys/windows/from_raw_arc.rs` (line 102)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

    #[test]
    fn smoke() {
        let a = FromRawArc::new(1);
        assert_eq!(*a, 1);
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
  


### Line 109: `#[test]`

- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

    #[test]
    fn drops() {
        struct A<'a>(&'a mut bool);
        impl Drop for A<'_> {
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
