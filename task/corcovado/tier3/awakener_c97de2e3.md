---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 22: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    /// Send a wakeup signal to the `Selector` on which the `Awakener` was registered.
    pub fn wakeup(&self) -> io::Result<()> {
        let inner_locked = self.inner.lock().unwrap();
        let &(token, ref weak_port) = inner_locked
            .as_ref()
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 50: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        _opts: PollOpt,
    ) -> io::Result<()> {
        let mut inner_locked = self.inner.lock().unwrap();
        if inner_locked.is_some() {
            panic!("Called register on already-registered Awakener.");
```
