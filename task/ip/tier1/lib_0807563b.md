- **File Hash**: 0807563b

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 449 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

- Line 80
  - hardcoded IP address

```rust
            .optional_string(
                "cidr",
                "CIDR notation for subnet operations (e.g., '192.168.1.0/24')",
            )
            .build()
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `plugin()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/plugins/ip/src/lib.rs` (line 526)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Create the plugin instance
#[allow(dead_code)]
fn plugin() -> McpPlugin<Ready> {
    mcp_plugin("ip")
        .description("Comprehensive IP address operations and network utilities")
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
