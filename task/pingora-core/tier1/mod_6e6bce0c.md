- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 230: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

    pub fn to_yaml(&self) -> String {
        serde_yaml::to_string(self).unwrap()
    }

```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 303: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        "#
        .to_string();
        let conf = ServerConf::from_yaml(&conf_str).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(2, conf.client_bind_to_ipv4.len());
        assert_eq!(0, conf.client_bind_to_ipv6.len());
```

### Line 317: `.unwrap()`

```rust
        "#
        .to_string();
        let conf = ServerConf::from_yaml(&conf_str).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(0, conf.client_bind_to_ipv4.len());

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 255: `#[cfg]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/pingora/pingora-core/src/server/configuration/mod.rs` (line 255)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
  


### Line 263: `#[test]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/pingora/pingora-core/src/server/configuration/mod.rs` (line 263)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

    #[test]
    fn not_a_test_i_cannot_write_yaml_by_hand() {
        init_log();
        let conf = ServerConf {
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory

### Line 292: `#[test]`

- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

    #[test]

        let conf_str = r#"
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory

  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
  


### Line 310: `#[test]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/pingora/pingora-core/src/server/configuration/mod.rs` (line 310)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

    #[test]
    fn test_default() {
        init_log();
        let conf_str = r#"
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
