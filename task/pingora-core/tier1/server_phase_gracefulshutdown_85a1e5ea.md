---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 54
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
    // installed yet.
    //
    // TODO: signal handlers are installed after Running phase
    // message is sent, sleep for now to avoid test flake
    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(500));
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.


- Line 55
  - for now
  - 

```rust
    //
    // TODO: signal handlers are installed after Running phase
    // message is sent, sleep for now to avoid test flake
    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(500));

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 82: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Should use .expect() with descriptive message in tests

```rust
    ));

    join.join().unwrap();

    assert!(matches!(
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
