  - hardcoded IP address
  - 

```rust
                const ZERO: IpAddr = IpAddr::V4(Ipv4Addr::new(0, 0, 0, 0));
                if self.ip() == ZERO {
                    // https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1122.html#section-3.2.1.3
                    // 0.0.0.0 should only be used as source IP not destination
                    // However in some systems this destination IP is mapped to 127.0.0.1.
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 260: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            SocketAddr::Unix(addr) => addr
                .as_pathname()
                .expect("non-pathname unix sockets not supported as peer")
                .check_fd_match(fd),
        }
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
