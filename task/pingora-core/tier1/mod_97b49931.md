- **Project**: pingora-core
- **File Hash**: 97b49931

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 408 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 188
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
    listen_fds: Option<ListenFds>,
    shutdown_watch: watch::Sender<bool>,
    // TODO: we many want to drop this copy to let sender call closed()
    shutdown_recv: ShutdownWatch,

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

```rust

// TODO: delete the pid when exit

impl Server {

## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 532
  - block_on
  - 

```rust

        // blocked on main loop so that it runs forever
        // Only work steal runtime can use block_on()
        let server_runtime = Server::create_runtime("Server", 1, true);
        #[cfg(unix)]
```

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 139: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
impl ShutdownSignalWatch for UnixShutdownSignalWatch {
    async fn recv(&self) -> ShutdownSignal {
        let mut graceful_upgrade_signal = unix::signal(unix::SignalKind::quit()).unwrap();
        let mut graceful_terminate_signal = unix::signal(unix::SignalKind::terminate()).unwrap();
        let mut fast_shutdown_signal = unix::signal(unix::SignalKind::interrupt()).unwrap();
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 140: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    async fn recv(&self) -> ShutdownSignal {
        let mut graceful_upgrade_signal = unix::signal(unix::SignalKind::quit()).unwrap();
        let mut graceful_terminate_signal = unix::signal(unix::SignalKind::terminate()).unwrap();
        let mut fast_shutdown_signal = unix::signal(unix::SignalKind::interrupt()).unwrap();
