---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 378 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 91: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
