```rust
                    .expect("newly created OnceCell must be empty");
                s.set_socket_digest(digest);
                // TODO: if listening on a specific bind address, we could save
                // an extra syscall looking up the local_addr later if we can pass
                // and init it in the socket digest here
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 82: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                    .peer_addr
                    .set(Some(peer_addr.into()))
                    .expect("newly created OnceCell must be empty");
                s.set_socket_digest(digest);
                // TODO: if listening on a specific bind address, we could save
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 99: `.expect()`

                    .expect("newly created OnceCell must be empty");
