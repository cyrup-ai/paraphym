```rust

        while let Some(event) = reuse_event {
            // TODO: with no steal runtime, consider spawn() the next event on

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 231: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            )
            .await
            .expect("Failed to build listeners");

        let app_logic = self
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 236: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            .app_logic
            .take()
            .expect("can only start_service() once");
        let app_logic = Arc::new(app_logic);
