- **Project**: pingora-core
- **File Hash**: c9e53e06

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 439 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 368
  - TODO
  - 

```rust

    /// Return a digest of the request including the method, path and Host header
    // TODO: make this use a `Formatter`
    pub fn request_summary(&self) -> String {
        match self {
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.


- Line 455
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
    /// Send an error response to a client with a response header and body.
    pub async fn write_error_response(&mut self, resp: ResponseHeader, body: Bytes) -> Result<()> {
        // TODO: we shouldn't be closing downstream connections on internally generated errors
        // and possibly other upstream connect() errors (connection refused, timeout, etc)
        //
```

## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 177
  - actual
  - 

```rust
            // writing 0 byte to a chunked encoding h1 would finish the stream
            // writing 0 bytes to h2 is noop
            // we don't want to actually write in either cases
            return Ok(());
        }
```

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 563: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            Self::H1(s) => s.write_continue_response().await,
            Self::H2(s) => s.write_response_header(
                Box::new(ResponseHeader::build(100, Some(0)).unwrap()),
                false,
            ),
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
