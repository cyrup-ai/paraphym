---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 21
  - TODO

```rust
use tokio::sync::oneshot::{channel, Sender};

// TODO: use pingora_runtime
// a shared runtime (thread pools)
pub(crate) struct OffloadRuntime {
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 55
  - block_on
  - 

```rust
                .spawn(move || {
                    debug!("Offload thread started");
                    // the thread that calls block_on() will drive the runtime
                    // rx will return when tx is dropped so this runtime and thread will exit
                    rt.block_on(rx)
```

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 48: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            // We use single thread runtimes to reduce the scheduling overhead of multithread
            // tokio runtime, which can be 50% of the on CPU time of the runtimes
            let rt = Builder::new_current_thread().enable_all().build().unwrap();
            let handler = rt.handle().clone();
            let (tx, rx) = channel::<()>();
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "

            pools.push((handler, tx));
