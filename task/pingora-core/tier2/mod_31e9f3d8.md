---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 548 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 2 (possible) Infractions 


- Line 15
  - dummy
  - 

```rust
// limitations under the License.

//! This module contains a dummy TLS implementation for the scenarios where real TLS
//! implementations are unavailable.

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 3 Evaluations


- Line 131
  - legacy
  - 

```rust
    pub struct SslAcceptor;
    impl SslAcceptor {
        /// Creates a new builder configured to connect to non-legacy clients. This should
        /// generally be considered a reasonable default choice.
        pub fn mozilla_intermediate_v5(
