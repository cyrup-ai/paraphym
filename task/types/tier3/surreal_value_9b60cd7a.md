- **Project**: types
- **File Hash**: 9b60cd7a

- **Lines of Code**: 479

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 479 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Orphaned Methods


### `geo_polygon()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/types/tests/surreal_value.rs` (line 426)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

fn geo_polygon() -> geo::Polygon {
	geo::Polygon::new(geo_line(), vec![geo_line()])
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `geo_point()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/types/tests/surreal_value.rs` (line 409)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
);

fn geo_point() -> geo::Point {
	geo::Point::new(10.0, 10.0)
}
```
