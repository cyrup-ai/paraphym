---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 572 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Orphaned Methods


### `convertion_error()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/types/src/traits/surreal_value.rs` (line 672)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

fn convertion_error(expected: Kind, got: Value) -> anyhow::Error {
	anyhow::anyhow!("Expected {}, got {:?}", expected, got.value_kind())
}
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
