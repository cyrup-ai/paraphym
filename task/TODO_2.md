# TODO_2: Fix "Real Implementation" Comment in Episodic System

## OBJECTIVE
Remove or replace the "in a real implementation" comment in episodic memory system with either proper implementation or clear documentation of current approach.

## PRIORITY
üü° HIGH - Code quality and production readiness

## BACKGROUND
Line 397 of `episodic.rs` contains a comment suggesting the current implementation is not "real" or production-ready. This needs investigation and resolution.

## SUBTASK 1: Investigate Current Implementation
**File:** `packages/candle/src/memory/core/systems/episodic.rs`  
**Line:** 397

**Action:**
- Read surrounding code context (lines 390-410)
- Understand what the current implementation does
- Determine if it's actually incomplete or if comment is misleading

**Questions to answer:**
- What functionality is currently implemented?
- What would a "real implementation" look like?
- Is current code production-ready or truly a stub?

## SUBTASK 2: Choose Resolution Path

**Path A: If code is production-ready**
- Remove TODO comment
- Add proper documentation explaining the approach
- Clarify why this implementation is correct

**Path B: If code is truly incomplete**
- Implement the full production version
- Remove TODO comment
- Document the implementation

**Path C: If feature is deferred**
- Document why feature is deferred
- Add clear documentation of current limitations
- Create tracking issue for future implementation
- Remove TODO from code, move to issue tracker

## SUBTASK 3: Update Documentation
**Action:** Based on chosen path, update code with appropriate documentation

**Requirements:**
- Clear explanation of what code does
- No misleading "in a real" language
- Production-quality comments

## DEFINITION OF DONE
- [ ] Code context investigated and understood
- [ ] TODO comment removed
- [ ] Proper documentation added
- [ ] Code is production-ready OR clearly documented as deferred
- [ ] No misleading "in a real implementation" language
- [ ] Code compiles without warnings

## CONSTRAINTS
- ‚ùå DO NOT write unit tests
- ‚ùå DO NOT write integration tests
- ‚ùå DO NOT write benchmarks
- ‚úÖ Focus solely on ./src modifications

## TECHNICAL NOTES
- Context around line 397 suggests this is about memory repository access
- May involve RwLock usage pattern
- Current implementation might be using a different but valid approach
- Investigate git history to understand original intent
