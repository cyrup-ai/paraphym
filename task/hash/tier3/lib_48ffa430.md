- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/plugins/hash/src/lib.rs` (line 136)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Create the plugin instance
#[allow(dead_code)]
fn plugin() -> McpPlugin<Ready> {
    mcp_plugin("hash")
        .description("Cryptographic hashing and encoding operations with support for SHA family, MD5, base64, and base32")
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
