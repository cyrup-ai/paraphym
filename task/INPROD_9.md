# INPROD_9: Resource DAO Caching Implementation

## SEVERITY: HIGH

## OBJECTIVE
Implement actual cache write and invalidation in the resource DAO operations. Caching is currently disabled due to mutable access issues.

## LOCATION
- `packages/sweetmcp/packages/axum/src/resource/cms/resource_dao/operations.rs`

## CURRENT STATE
- Line 229: `// Note: This would need proper mutable access in a real implementation`
- Line 268: `// Note: This would need proper mutable access in a real implementation`
- Cache reads may work but writes and invalidations are skipped
- enable_caching config is effectively ignored for writes

## SUBTASK 1: Fix Cache Write Implementation
- Locate operations.rs:229 in the read/get method
- Solve the mutable access issue for cache writes
- Use interior mutability (Mutex/RwLock) or refactor structure
- Actually cache the resource after reading from database

## SUBTASK 2: Fix Cache Invalidation Implementation
- Locate operations.rs:268 in the update/delete method
- Solve the mutable access issue for cache invalidation
- Remove stale cache entries when resources are modified
- Ensure cache consistency after updates

## SUBTASK 3: Refactor for Proper Mutability
- Consider using RwLock<HashMap> or DashMap for cache
- Update ResourceDao structure if needed
- Ensure thread-safe concurrent cache access
- Maintain performance characteristics

## DEFINITION OF DONE
- [ ] Cache writes actually store resources
- [ ] Cache invalidation actually removes entries
- [ ] Mutable access issues are resolved
- [ ] enable_caching config is fully functional
- [ ] Thread safety is maintained
- [ ] Stub comments removed

## RESEARCH NOTES
- Review ResourceDao structure and cache field type
- Check for existing cache implementations in the codebase
- Examine DashMap usage elsewhere for concurrent caching
- Review read/write patterns for cache access

## CONSTRAINTS
- NO test code to be written (separate team responsibility)
- NO benchmark code to be written (separate team responsibility)
- Focus solely on ./src implementation
