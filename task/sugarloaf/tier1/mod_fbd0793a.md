---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 845 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

  - in a real

```rust
    let mut scaler = context.builder(*font).size(size).hint(hint).build();
    // Compute the fractional offset-- you'll likely want to quantize this
    // in a real renderer
    let offset = Vector::new(x.fract(), y.fract());
    // Select our source order
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

bitmaps. Alternatively, you can request raw, optionally hinted
[outlines](Outline) that can then be further processed by [zeno] or
fed into other crates like [lyon](https://github.com/nical/lyon) or
[pathfinder](https://github.com/servo/pathfinder) for tessellation and
GPU rendering.
