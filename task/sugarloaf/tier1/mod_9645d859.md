```rust
    let mut format: wgpu::TextureFormat = formats.first().unwrap().to_owned();

    // FIXME: On Nvidia GPUs usage Rgba16Float texture format causes driver to enable HDR.
    // Reason for this is currently output color space is poorly defined in wgpu and

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 24: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    colorspace: Colorspace,
) -> wgpu::TextureFormat {
    let mut format: wgpu::TextureFormat = formats.first().unwrap().to_owned();

    // TODO: Fix formats with signs
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 65: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

    if !final_formats.is_empty() {
