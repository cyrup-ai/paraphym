---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 723 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

```rust

- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 425: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                }
                FindResult::NotFound(spec) => {
                    self.insert(FontData::from_slice(FONT_TWEMOJI_EMOJI, true).unwrap());
                    if !spec.is_default_family() {
                        fonts_not_fount.push(spec);
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "

## Tests in Source Directory


### Line 10: `#[cfg]`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/sugarloaf/src/font/mod.rs` (line 10)
- **Issue**: Tests must be in `./tests` directory, not in `./src`

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod cjk_metrics_tests;

pub const FONT_ID_REGULAR: usize = 0;
```

### Action Required

- Extract tests into `./tests` directory
  - `tests/` should mirror the file structure of the `src/` with file names prepended with `test_`
  - Update this section with specific remediation instructions
  

## Orphaned Methods


### `find_font_path()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/sugarloaf/src/font/mod.rs` (line 875)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

#[allow(dead_code)]
fn find_font_path(
    db: &crate::font::loader::Database,
    font_family: String,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
