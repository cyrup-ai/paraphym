---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 226: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        return false;
    }
    let font = current_font.as_ref().unwrap();
    let font_ref = font.font();
    let id = font
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "

## Orphaned Methods


### `shape()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/sugarloaf/src/font_introspector/shape/partition.rs` (line 158)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// and a prepared [`Shaper`] that contains the cluster content of the fragment.
#[allow(unused)]
pub fn shape<S, T>(
    context: &mut ShapeContext,
    selector: &mut S,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
