---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 1623 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Orphaned Methods


### `language_index()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/sugarloaf/src/font_introspector/internal/aat.rs` (line 1037)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

    /// Returns the `ltag` index for the specified language.
    pub fn language_index(data: &[u8], ltag: u32, language: &str) -> Option<u32> {
        let name = language.as_bytes();
        let b = Bytes::with_offset(data, ltag as usize)?;
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
