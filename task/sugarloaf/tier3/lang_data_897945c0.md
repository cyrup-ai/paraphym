### `tag4()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/sugarloaf/src/font_introspector/text/lang_data.rs` (line 14)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

pub const fn tag4(b: &[u8; 4]) -> u32 {
    (b[0] as u32) << 24 | (b[1] as u32) << 16 | (b[2] as u32) << 8 | b[3] as u32
}
```

### Action Required:
