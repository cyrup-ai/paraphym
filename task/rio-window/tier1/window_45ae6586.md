---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 325 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 233
  - TODO
  - 

```rust

        #[method(performWindowDragWithEvent:)]
        // TODO: Can this actually accept NULL?
        pub(crate) fn performWindowDragWithEvent(&self, event: Option<&NSEvent>);

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

```rust
// It seems like there was a push towards using "key" values instead of the
// raw window level values, and then you were supposed to use
// `CGWindowLevelForKey` to get the actual level.
//
// But the values that `NSWindowLevel` has are compiled in, and as such has
