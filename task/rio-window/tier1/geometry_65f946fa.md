- Line 253
  - Hopeful

```rust
        let nested = !(window == child || self.is_top_level(child, root) == Some(true));

        // Hopefully the WM supports EWMH, allowing us to get exact info on the window frames.
        if let Some(mut frame_extents) = self.get_frame_extents(window) {
            // Mutter/Muffin/Budgie and Marco preserve their decorated frame extents when
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 231: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            let coords = self
                .translate_coords(window, root)
                .expect("Failed to translate window coordinates");
            (coords.dst_y, coords.child)
        };
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 238: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            let inner_geometry = self
                .get_geometry(window)
                .expect("Failed to get inner window geometry");

### Line 290: `.expect()`

                .expect("Failed to climb window hierarchy");
