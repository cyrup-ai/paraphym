---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 928 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 1215: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                event.keyCode(),
            )
            .unwrap()
        }
    } else {
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 878: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            ._ns_window
            .load()
            .expect("view to have a window")
    }

```

### Line 901: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    fn current_input_source(&self) -> String {
        self.inputContext()
            .expect("input context")
            .selectedKeyboardInputSource()
            .map(|input_source| input_source.to_string())
```

```rust
            event
                .charactersIgnoringModifiers()
                .expect("expected characters to be non-null")
        };

```

## Orphaned Methods


### `replace_event()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/macos/view.rs` (line 1185)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
// we're getting from the operating system, which makes it
// impossible to provide such events as extra in `KeyEvent`.
fn replace_event(event: &NSEvent, option_as_alt: OptionAsAlt) -> Retained<NSEvent> {
    let ev_mods = event_mods(event).state;
    let ignore_alt_characters = match option_as_alt {
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
