```rust
        f: impl FnOnce(&WindowDelegate) + Send + 'static,
    ) {
        // For now, don't actually do queuing, since it may be less predictable
        self.maybe_wait_on_main(f)
    }
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
