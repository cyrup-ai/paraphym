- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: rio-window
- **File Hash**: 81bd1964

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 396 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 423
  - stubby method name
  - dummy_event

```rust
        // To stop event loop immediately, we need to post some event here.
        // See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48041279/stopping-the-nsapplication-main-event-loop/48064752#48064752
        app.postEvent_atStart(&dummy_event().unwrap(), true);
    });
}
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 423: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        // To stop event loop immediately, we need to post some event here.
        // See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48041279/stopping-the-nsapplication-main-event-loop/48064752#48064752
        app.postEvent_atStart(&dummy_event().unwrap(), true);
    });
}
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 443: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            // panicking
            {
                let panic_info = panic_info.upgrade().unwrap();
                panic_info.set_panic(e);

```rust
    ) -> Result<Self, EventLoopError> {
        let mtm = MainThreadMarker::new()
            .expect("on macOS, `EventLoop` must be created on the main thread!");

## Orphaned Methods


### `event_loop_proxy_handler()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/macos/event_loop.rs` (line 479)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
        unsafe {
            // just wake up the eventloop
            extern "C" fn event_loop_proxy_handler(_: *const c_void) {}

            // adding a Source to the main CFRunLoop lets us wake it up and
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
