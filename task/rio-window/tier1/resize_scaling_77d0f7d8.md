---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 125

```rust
    {
        let current_scale = super::scale_factor(window);
        // TODO: Remove `-webkit-device-pixel-ratio`. Requires Safari v16.
        let media_query = format!(
            "(resolution: {current_scale}dppx),
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.


- Line 212
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
        let scale = super::scale_factor(&this.window);

        // TODO: confirm/reproduce this problem, see:
        // <https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/2597>.
        // This should never happen, but if it does then apparently the scale factor didn't change.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 141: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    fn create_observer(canvas: &HtmlCanvasElement, closure: &JsValue) -> ResizeObserver {
        let observer = ResizeObserver::new(closure.as_ref().unchecked_ref())
            .expect("Failed to create `ResizeObserver`");

        // Safari doesn't support `devicePixelContentBoxSize`
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
