---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 23
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
    pub xlib: ffi::Xlib,

    // TODO(notgull): I'd like to remove this, but apparently Xlib and Xinput2 are tied together
    // for some reason.
    pub xinput2: ffi::XInput2,
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.


- Line 175
  - TODO
  - 

```rust

        // Get PropertyNotify events from the XSETTINGS window.
        // TODO: The XSETTINGS window here can change. In the future, listen for DestroyNotify on
        // this window in order to accommodate for a changed window here.
        let selector_window = xcb

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 199: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    #[inline]
    pub fn check_errors(&self) -> Result<(), XError> {
        let error = self.latest_error.lock().unwrap().take();
        if let Some(error) = error {
            Err(error)
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 120: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            .expect("failed to request XRandR version")
            .reply()
            .expect("failed to query XRandR version");

        let xsettings_screen = Self::new_xsettings_screen(&xcb, default_screen);
```

### Line 118: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        let randr_version = xcb
            .randr_query_version(1, 3)
            .expect("failed to request XRandR version")
            .reply()

```rust

            .expect("xcb_connection somehow called after drop?")
    }
