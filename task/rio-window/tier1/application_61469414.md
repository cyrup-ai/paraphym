- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `NSApp()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/macos/appkit/application.rs` (line 20)
- **Visibility**: pub(crate)
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
);

pub(crate) fn NSApp() -> Id<NSApplication> {
    // TODO: Only allow access from main thread
    NSApplication::shared(unsafe { MainThreadMarker::new_unchecked() })
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
