---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 778 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

- Line 1720
  - for now

```rust
    /// ## Platform-specific
    ///
    /// - **macOS:** Not implemented. Always returns [`ExternalError::NotSupported`] for now.
    /// - **iOS / Android / Web:** Always returns an [`ExternalError::NotSupported`].
    Confined,

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Tier 2 (possible) Infractions 


- Line 72

```rust
