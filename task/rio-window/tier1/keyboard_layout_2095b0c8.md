- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: rio-window
- **File Hash**: 2095b0c8

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 861 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 338
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
            let keycode = match scancode_to_physicalkey(scancode) {
                PhysicalKey::Code(code) => code,
                // TODO: validate that we can skip on unidentified keys (probably never occurs?)
                _ => continue,
            };
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

                        // HACK: `ToUnicodeEx` seems to fail getting the string for the numpad
                        // divide key, so we handle that explicitly here
                        if !has_alt && !has_ctrl && key_code == KeyCode::NumpadDivide {

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 452: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                    // then the alt modifier state must have come before.
                    let simple_keys =
                        layout.keys.get(&WindowsModifiers::empty()).unwrap();
                    if let Some(Key::Character(key_no_altgr)) = simple_keys.get(&key_code)
                    {
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
