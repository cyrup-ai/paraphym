---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 403 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 34
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
pub use state::XkbState;

// TODO: Wire this up without using a static `AtomicBool`.
static RESET_DEAD_KEYS: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 258: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                unsafe {
                    self.scratch_buffer
                        .set_len(bytes_written.try_into().unwrap())
                };
                break;
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 285: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                if RESET_DEAD_KEYS.swap(false, Ordering::SeqCst) {
                    state.reset();
                    context.compose_state2.as_mut().unwrap().reset();

                    let state = self.context.compose_state1.as_mut().unwrap();
