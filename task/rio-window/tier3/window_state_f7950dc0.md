---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 459 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

```rust
        /// In most cases, it's okay to let those parameters change the state. However, when we're
        /// running the `WindowFlags::apply_diff` function, we *don't* want those parameters to
        /// effect our stored state, because the purpose of `apply_diff` is to update the actual
        /// window's state to match our stored state. This controls whether to accept those changes.
        const MARKER_RETAIN_STATE_ON_SIZE = 1 << 15;
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.
