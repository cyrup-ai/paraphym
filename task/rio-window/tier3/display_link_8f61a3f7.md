---## Orphaned Methods


### `display_link_callback()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/macos/display_link.rs` (line 287)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// This callback fires at exactly the right time for VSync, then uses
/// GCD to safely communicate with the main thread.
unsafe extern "C" fn display_link_callback(
    _display_link: CVDisplayLinkRef,
    current_time: *const CVTimeStamp,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
