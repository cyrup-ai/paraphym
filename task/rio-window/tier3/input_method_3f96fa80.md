- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

```rust
            // ibus to run fcitx, it retained the value denoting ibus. Even more surprising is
            // that the fcitx input method could only be successfully opened using "@im=ibus".
            // Presumably due to this quirk, it's actually possible to alternate between ibus and
            // fcitx in a running application.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 91: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        }

        let preedit_style = preedit_style.unwrap_or_else(|| none_style.unwrap());
        let none_style = none_style.unwrap_or(preedit_style);

```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 232: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    pub fn from_string(string: String) -> Self {
        let c_string = CString::new(string.clone())
            .expect("String used to construct CString contained null byte");
        InputMethodName { c_string, string }
    }
```

### Line 238: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    pub fn from_str(string: &str) -> Self {
        let c_string = CString::new(string)
            .expect("String used to construct CString contained null byte");
        InputMethodName {
            c_string,
