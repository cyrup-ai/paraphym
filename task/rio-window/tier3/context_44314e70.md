- **Path**: /Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym
- **Project**: rio-window
- **File Hash**: 44314e70

---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 324 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 53: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        .event_sender
        .send((client_data.window, ImeEvent::Start))
        .expect("failed to send preedit start event");
    -1
}
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "

## Orphaned Methods


### `preedit_done_callback()`

- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

/// Done callback is used when the preedit should be hidden.
extern "C" fn preedit_done_callback(
    _xim: ffi::XIM,
    client_data: ffi::XPointer,
```

- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
