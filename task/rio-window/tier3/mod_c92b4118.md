---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 842 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 667: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        // Call all the hooks.
        let mut error_handled = false;
        for hook in XLIB_ERROR_HOOKS.lock().unwrap().iter() {
            error_handled |= hook(display as *mut _, event as *mut _);
        }
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 699: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            tracing::error!("X11 error: {:#?}", error);
            // XXX only update the error, if it wasn't handled by any of the hooks.
            *xconn.latest_error.lock().unwrap() = Some(error);
        }
    }
```

### Line 986: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

                Ok(raw_window_handle::WaylandDisplayHandle::new(
                    NonNull::new(conn.display().id().as_ptr().cast()).unwrap(),
                )
                .into())
```

## Orphaned Methods


### `x_error_callback()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/linux/mod.rs` (line 659)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

#[cfg(x11_platform)]
unsafe extern "C" fn x_error_callback(
    display: *mut x11::ffi::Display,
    event: *mut x11::ffi::XErrorEvent,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
