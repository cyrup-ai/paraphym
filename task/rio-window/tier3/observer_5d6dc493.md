---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 37: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    std::mem::forget(info_from_raw);

    let mtm = MainThreadMarker::new().unwrap();
    stop_app_on_panic(mtm, Weak::clone(&panic_info), move || {
        let _ = &panic_info;
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 56: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                kCFRunLoopAfterWaiting => {
                    // trace!("Triggered `CFRunLoopAfterWaiting`");
                    ApplicationDelegate::get(MainThreadMarker::new().unwrap())
                        .wakeup(panic_info);
                    // trace!("Completed `CFRunLoopAfterWaiting`");
```

### Line 79: `.unwrap()`

- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

                    // trace!("Triggered `CFRunLoopBeforeWaiting`");
                    ApplicationDelegate::get(MainThreadMarker::new().unwrap())
                        .cleared(panic_info);

## Orphaned Methods


### `wakeup_main_loop()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/macos/observer.rs` (line 173)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
impl Default for EventLoopWaker {
    fn default() -> EventLoopWaker {
        extern "C" fn wakeup_main_loop(_timer: CFRunLoopTimerRef, _info: *mut c_void) {}
        unsafe {
            // Create a timer with a 0.1Âµs interval (1ns does not work) to mimic polling.
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `control_flow_begin_handler()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/macos/observer.rs` (line 45)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

// begin is queued with the highest priority to ensure it is processed before other observers
extern "C" fn control_flow_begin_handler(
    _: CFRunLoopObserverRef,
    activity: CFRunLoopActivity,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `control_flow_end_handler()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/macos/observer.rs` (line 68)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
// end is queued with the lowest priority to ensure it is processed after other observers
// without that, LoopExiting would  get sent after AboutToWait
extern "C" fn control_flow_end_handler(
    _: CFRunLoopObserverRef,
    activity: CFRunLoopActivity,
```

### Action Required:
