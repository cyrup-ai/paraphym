---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 53: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

    pub fn into_inner(mut self, _: MainThreadMarker) -> T {
        self.0.take().expect("already taken or dropped")
    }

```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 57: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust

    pub fn get(&self, _: MainThreadMarker) -> &T {
        self.0.as_ref().expect("already taken or dropped")
    }
}
```

### Line 79: `.expect()`

```rust
                    .expect("drop handler not initialized when setting canvas")
                    .send(DropBox(Box::new(value)))
