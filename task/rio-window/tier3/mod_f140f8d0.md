---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 436 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

### Line 80: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            // Ensure that window exists.
            let mut window = match self.windows.get_mut().get_mut(&window_id) {
                Some(window) => window.lock().unwrap(),
                None => continue,
            };
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 145: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
