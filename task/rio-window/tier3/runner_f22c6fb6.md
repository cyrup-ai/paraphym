---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 315 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 392: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                    .unwrap()
                    .lock()
                    .unwrap(),
            ),
            event => BufferedEvent::Event(event),
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 390: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()

                    .unwrap()

```rust

                });
                let inner_size = *user_new_innner_size.lock().unwrap();

                drop(user_new_innner_size);

### Line 239: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    fn call_event_handler(&self, event: Event<T>) {
        self.catch_unwind(|| {
            let mut event_handler = self.event_handler.take().expect(
                "either event handler is re-entrant (likely), or no event handler is registered \
                 (very unlikely)",
```
