---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 24: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                // SAFETY: The given `Closure` here isn't really `'static`, so we shouldn't do
                // anything funny with it here. See `Self::queue()`.
                closure(value.borrow().as_ref().unwrap())
            },
            {
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 33: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
