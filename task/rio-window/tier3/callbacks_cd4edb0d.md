            let _ = unsafe { set_instantiate_callback(xconn, client_data) };
            // Attempt to open fallback input method.

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `xim_instantiate_callback()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/linux/x11/ime/callbacks.rs` (line 167)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

pub unsafe extern "C" fn xim_instantiate_callback(
    _display: *mut ffi::Display,
    client_data: ffi::XPointer,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `xim_destroy_callback()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/linux/x11/ime/callbacks.rs` (line 194)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
// happens, XCloseIM/XDestroyIC doesn't need to be called, as the resources have already been
// free'd (attempting to do so causes our connection to freeze).
pub unsafe extern "C" fn xim_destroy_callback(
    _xim: ffi::XIM,
    client_data: ffi::XPointer,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
