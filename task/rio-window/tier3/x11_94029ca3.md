---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 83: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    crate::platform_impl::XLIB_ERROR_HOOKS
        .lock()
        .unwrap()
        .push(hook);
}
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "

## Orphaned Methods


### `register_xlib_error_hook()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform/x11.rs` (line 79)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// [`unsafe`]: https://www.remlab.net/op/xlib.shtml
#[inline]
pub fn register_xlib_error_hook(hook: XlibErrorHook) {
    // Append new hook.
    crate::platform_impl::XLIB_ERROR_HOOKS
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
