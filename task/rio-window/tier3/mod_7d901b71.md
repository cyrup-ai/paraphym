```rust
pub(crate) struct Ime {
    xconn: Arc<XConnection>,
    // The actual meat of this struct is boxed away, since it needs to have a fixed location in
    // memory so we can pass a pointer to it around.
    inner: Box<ImeInner>,
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

```rust
    // This pattern is used for various methods here:
    // Ok(_) indicates that nothing went wrong internally
    // Ok(true) indicates that the action was actually performed
    // Ok(false) indicates that the action is not presently applicable

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 125: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            None
        } else {
            let im = self.inner.im.as_ref().unwrap();
            let style = if with_preedit {
                im.preedit_style
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 159: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                .event_sender
                .send((window, event))
                .expect("Failed to send enabled event");

            Some(context)
```
