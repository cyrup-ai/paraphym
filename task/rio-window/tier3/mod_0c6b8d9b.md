```rust
        // SAFETY: The `transmute` is necessary because `run()` requires `'static`. This is safe
        // because this function will never return and all resources not cleaned up by the point we
        // `throw` will leak, making this actually `'static`.
        let handler = unsafe { std::mem::transmute(handler) };
        self.elw.p.run(handler, false);
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 59: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                    self.user_event_receiver
                        .try_recv()
                        .expect("handler woken up without user event"),
                ),
                Err(_) => unreachable!(),
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
