---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 153: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        .expect("Element was not inserted into the DOM or is not a size in pixel")
        .parse()
        .expect("CSS property is not a size in pixel")
}

```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
