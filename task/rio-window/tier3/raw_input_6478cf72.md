---## Orphaned Methods


### `get_raw_input_device_info()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/windows/raw_input.rs` (line 82)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

#[allow(dead_code)]
pub fn get_raw_input_device_info(handle: HANDLE) -> Option<RawDeviceInfo> {
    let mut info: RID_DEVICE_INFO = unsafe { mem::zeroed() };
    let info_size = size_of::<RID_DEVICE_INFO>() as u32;
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `get_raw_input_device_list()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/windows/raw_input.rs` (line 33)
- **Visibility**: pub
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

#[allow(dead_code)]
pub fn get_raw_input_device_list() -> Option<Vec<RAWINPUTDEVICELIST>> {
    let list_size = size_of::<RAWINPUTDEVICELIST>() as u32;

```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
