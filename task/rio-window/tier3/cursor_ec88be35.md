---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 38: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
                Format::Argb8888,
            )
            .unwrap();

        for (canvas_chunk, rgba) in
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 49: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            let b = (rgba[2] as f32 * alpha) as u32;
            let color = ((rgba[3] as u32) << 24) + (r << 16) + (g << 8) + b;
            let array: &mut [u8; 4] = canvas_chunk.try_into().unwrap();
            *array = color.to_le_bytes();
        }
```
