---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 156: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    #[inline]
    pub fn name(&self) -> Option<String> {
        let monitor_info = get_monitor_info(self.0).unwrap();
        Some(
            decode_wide(&monitor_info.szDevice)
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 166: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    #[inline]
    pub fn native_identifier(&self) -> String {
        self.name().unwrap()
    }

```

### Line 176: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
    #[inline]
    pub fn size(&self) -> PhysicalSize<u32> {
        let rc_monitor = get_monitor_info(self.0).unwrap().monitorInfo.rcMonitor;
        PhysicalSize {
            width: (rc_monitor.right - rc_monitor.left) as u32,
```

## Orphaned Methods


### `monitor_enum_proc()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/packages/sixel6vt/vendor/rio/rio-window/src/platform_impl/windows/monitor.rs` (line 87)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
unsafe impl Sync for MonitorHandle {}

unsafe extern "system" fn monitor_enum_proc(
    hmonitor: HMONITOR,
    _hdc: HDC,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
