---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 100: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
	});
	// Return the chunked body
	Ok(Response::builder().status(StatusCode::OK).body(body).unwrap())
}
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "

## Orphaned Methods


### `get_handler()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/src/net/export.rs` (line 31)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

async fn get_handler(
	Extension(state): Extension<AppState>,
	Extension(session): Extension<Session>,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.


### `post_handler()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/src/net/export.rs` (line 39)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

async fn post_handler(
	Extension(state): Extension<AppState>,
	Extension(session): Extension<Session>,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
