```rust

				Some(Accept::ApplicationJson) => {
					// TODO(3.0): This code here is using the wrong serialization method which might
					// result in some values of the code being serialized wrong.

```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Orphaned Methods


### `handler()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/src/net/import.rs` (line 31)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

async fn handler(
	Extension(state): Extension<AppState>,
	Extension(session): Extension<Session>,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
