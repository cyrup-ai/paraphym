## Orphaned Methods


### `client_ip_middleware()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/src/net/client_ip.rs` (line 113)
- **Visibility**: pub(restricted)
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
}

pub(super) async fn client_ip_middleware(
	request: Request,
	next: Next,
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
