---## Orphaned Methods


### `plugin()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/packages/sweetmcp/plugins/time/src/lib.rs` (line 116)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust
/// Create the plugin instance
#[allow(dead_code)]
fn plugin() -> McpPlugin<Ready> {
    mcp_plugin("time")
        .description("Time operations including getting current time and parsing time strings")
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
