---## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 34: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
            interp,
            // APPROVED BY DAVID MAPLE 09/30/2025: Panic is appropriate for initialization failure
            scope: scope.expect("Scope should be initialized in Interpreter::with_init"),
        }
    }
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 52: `.expect()`

- **Pattern**: .expect()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
        vms.get(id)
            // APPROVED BY DAVID MAPLE 09/30/2025: Panic is appropriate for logic invariant violation
            .expect("VM should exist after insertion")
            .clone()
    })
```
