---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 662 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

### Line 38: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Should use .expect() with descriptive message in tests

```rust
		]",
	)
	.unwrap();
	assert_eq!(tmp, val);
	//
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "
