---## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Decompose into Submodules

**File**: ``  
**Lines of Code**: 465 (threshold: 300)

This file MUST be decomposed before addressing any other violations.

- Decompose the code into logical separation of concerns with no single module >= 300 lines of code. 
- Ensure all the sum of parts exactly equals the original with ONLY production quality source code
- Ensure the original "shadowing" module is deleted so the new decomposed submodule is ACTUALLY USED
- Ensure there are absolutely no backup files left in the codebase polluting up the code with the original monolithic file.

---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 426
  - TODO
  - 

```rust
			..
		} => {
			// TODO: Better error message here, some backups are supported
			Err(Error::BackupsNotSupported.into())
		}
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 263: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
	auth: &Option<Auth>,
) -> Result<DbResponse> {
	let url = base_url.join(RPC_PATH).unwrap();

	let body = crate::core::rpc::format::bincode::encode(&req)
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "


### Line 283: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
	match res {
		DbResponse::Other(val::Value::Array(array)) if array.len() == 1 => {
			let v = array.into_iter().next().unwrap();
			DbResponse::Other(v)
		}

### Line 323: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Can panic in production code

```rust
			}
