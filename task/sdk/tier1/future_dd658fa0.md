---## Tier 1 Infractions 


- Line 22
  - TODO

```rust
	/// `millis`
	fn query(count: usize, millis: usize) -> String {
		// TODO: Find a simpler way to trigger the concurrent future case.
		format!(
			"SELECT foo FROM [[{}]] TIMEOUT {TIMEOUT}ms;",
```

- is this actually a non-production indicator or a false positive? If false positive, remove it from the task file.
- If IT IS a non-production fake, fabrication, incomplete, dangeours or lacking implementation: add detailed notes explaining the issue and plan out the necessary replacement work in sequential steps. 
- Update this section of the task file with the notes and plan.

## Panic-Prone Code


### Line 50: `.unwrap()`

- **Pattern**: .unwrap()
- **Issue**: Should use .expect() with descriptive message in tests

```rust
				assert_eq!(res.len(), 1);

				let res = res.into_iter().next().unwrap();

				let elapsed = res.time.as_millis() as usize;
```

### Action Required

- unwrap() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` or `./tests/**/*.rs` (period). The code should be updated with proper error handling and all match arms addressed.
- unwrap_or_else() is a-ok. 
- expect() should never be used in `./src/**/*.rs` but should ALWAYS BE USED in `./tests/**/*.rs` (rather than unwrap)
- panic can be approved with my written consent for situations that should in practice never happen  
  - ASK FOR WRITTEN PERMISSION
  - If granted, annotate the code with a comment "APPROVED PANIC "

## Orphaned Methods


### `test_limit()`

- **Location**: `/Volumes/samsung_t9/paraphym/forks/surrealdb/crates/sdk/tests/future.rs` (line 33)
- **Visibility**: private
- **Issue**: Function is defined but never called anywhere in the codebase

```rust

	/// Returns `true` if `limit` futures are concurrently executed.
	async fn test_limit(limit: usize) -> Result<bool> {
		let sql = query(limit, MILLIS);
		let dbs = new_ds().await?;
```

### Action Required:

- Evaluate the intended purpose of the orphaned method, assuming it is intended to be used by default.
- If it should be used, update this section with instructions on how to incorporate it into the codebase.
- If it is deprecated, ask for permission to remove it.
- Update this section with your findings and instructions on how to proceed.
