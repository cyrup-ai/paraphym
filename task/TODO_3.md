# TODO_3: Implement Image Processing in Builders Module

## OBJECTIVE
Implement actual image processing functionality in the builders/image.rs module or remove the stub.

## PRIORITY
üü° HIGH - Feature completeness

## BACKGROUND
Line 223 of `builders/image.rs` contains "TODO: Implement actual processing" suggesting the feature is stubbed out. This needs either full implementation or clear deprecation.

## SUBTASK 1: Investigate Feature Context
**File:** `packages/candle/src/builders/image.rs`  
**Line:** 223

**Action:**
- Read the function containing the TODO (lines 210-240)
- Understand what image processing is expected
- Determine if feature is actively used or abandoned

**Questions to answer:**
- What is the function signature?
- What should it return?
- Who calls this function?
- Is this feature actively needed?

## SUBTASK 2: Choose Resolution Path

**Path A: Feature is needed - Implement it**
- Implement full image processing logic
- Remove TODO comment
- Add proper error handling
- Document the implementation

**Path B: Feature is not needed - Remove stub**
- Remove the stubbed function entirely
- Update any call sites
- Remove from public API if exposed
- Document removal in changelog

**Path C: Feature is deferred - Document clearly**
- Return appropriate error indicating feature not yet implemented
- Document in function-level docs that feature is planned
- Remove TODO from code, track in separate issue
- Ensure calling code handles unimplemented case

## SUBTASK 3: Implement or Remove
**Action:** Based on investigation, take appropriate action

**If implementing:**
```rust
/// Process image with specified transformations
pub fn process_image(image_data: &[u8], options: ImageOptions) -> Result<ProcessedImage, ImageError> {
    // Full implementation here
    // - Decode image
    // - Apply transformations
    // - Encode result
    todo!() // Replace with actual implementation
}
```

**If removing:**
- Delete function
- Remove from module exports
- Update call sites to handle removal

## DEFINITION OF DONE
- [ ] Feature context investigated
- [ ] Decision made: implement, remove, or defer
- [ ] Action completed based on decision
- [ ] TODO comment removed from code
- [ ] No stub implementations remaining
- [ ] Code compiles without warnings
- [ ] Call sites updated appropriately

## CONSTRAINTS
- ‚ùå DO NOT write unit tests
- ‚ùå DO NOT write integration tests
- ‚ùå DO NOT write benchmarks
- ‚úÖ Focus solely on ./src modifications

## TECHNICAL NOTES
- Image processing may require additional dependencies
- Consider using `image` crate if implementing
- Ensure proper error handling for corrupted images
- Performance implications of image processing should be considered
- May need async implementation for large images
