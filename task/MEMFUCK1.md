# MEMFUCK1: Temperature Handling Bug Still Present in Builder Methods

## Outstanding Issues: Temperature 0.0 Override Bug in Two Methods

### Critical Bugs Found
Two methods in `/packages/candle/src/builders/agent_role.rs` still contain the temperature override bug:

1. **Line 801 in `chat()` method:**
```rust
let temperature = if self.temperature == 0.0 { 0.7 } else { self.temperature };
```

2. **Line 1043 in `chat_with_message()` method:**
```rust
let temperature = if self.temperature == 0.0 { 0.7 } else { self.temperature };
```

### Required Fix
Since the builder now defaults to 0.7, these override checks must be removed:

**In both methods, change:**
```rust
let temperature = if self.temperature == 0.0 { 0.7 } else { self.temperature };
```

**To:**
```rust
let temperature = self.temperature;
```

### Definition of Done
- Remove temperature override in `chat()` method at line 801
- Remove temperature override in `chat_with_message()` method at line 1043
- Users can set temperature to 0.0 for deterministic generation in ALL code paths

## Previously Completed Items
✅ Builder default temperature changed from 0.0 to 0.7
✅ Temperature override removed from `generate_ai_response` in chat.rs
✅ Temperature override removed from `generate_ai_response_with_sectioning` in chat.rs
